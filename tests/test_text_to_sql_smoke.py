"""tests/test_text_to_sql_smoke.py: smoke test for fractal_text_to_sql().

One live end-to-end call against whatever reasoning plugin/model
mysqld was actually started with (FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN /
HTTP_URL / HTTP_MODEL, fixed at process start and read once from the
process environment): does the full GENERATE -> ALLOWLIST ->
EXPLAIN-equivalent pipeline run without erroring and return SQL that
actually executes? Deliberately not a correctness/relevance check (see
test_text_to_sql_shadow.py for that, against a real model). This is the
fast "is anything on fire" gate to run after every build, including
against scripts/ci/mock_llm.py's fixed reply with no real model
attached.

Skip-safe: exits 0 with a SKIP: message if the mysql connector is
missing, no DB is reachable, fractal_text_to_sql isn't deployed, the
reasoning plugin .so isn't present on this host, or the configured
endpoint doesn't respond.

Usage:
    python3 tests/test_text_to_sql_smoke.py
    FRACTALSQL_HOST=... python3 tests/test_text_to_sql_smoke.py
