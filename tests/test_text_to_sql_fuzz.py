"""tests/test_text_to_sql_fuzz.py: adversarial/fuzz suite for the
text-to-sql allowlist (fractal_t2s_check_allowlist) and the GENERATE
round trip (fractal_t2s_generate + fractal_text_to_sql).

Two structural notes, both already noted by mock_llm.py's
own docstring and this repo's src/fractalsql_textsql.c:

  1. fractal_t2s_check_allowlist(sql) is a standalone, deterministic,
     no-LLM-needed function (the allowlist check is deliberately
     factored out of fractal_text_to_sql() itself, so it can be
     exercised directly without getting a "model" to emit a specific
     string). Most of this
     suite exercises it directly: more scenarios, faster, no mock
     server needed for them at all.

  2. fractal_text_to_sql's reasoning config (which plugin/endpoint) is
     fixed at mysqld startup, read once from the process environment,
     so this suite can't point the pipeline at a fresh mock per
     scenario. The small GENERATE-path integration section
     instead uses
     _t2s_common.MutableMockLLMServer, bound to the SAME fixed port
     FRACTALSQL_HTTP_URL already names, and swaps its canned reply
     between scenarios.

  3. MySQL's WITH clause is SELECT-only at the CTE-body level too (no
     "WITH d AS (DELETE ...) SELECT ..." syntax exists in MySQL
     either) --
     see fractalsql_textsql.c's own header comment. A "data-modifying
     CTE hidden under a top-level SELECT"
     scenario is structurally impossible here; the equivalent hazard
     ("WITH cte AS (SELECT ...) DELETE FROM t WHERE id IN (SELECT ..
     FROM cte)", a CTE feeding a top-level DELETE) is legal in MySQL
     8.0+ and covered instead
     -- same case build_test.sh's gate 10 already exercises, repeated
     here as part of a broader adversarial sweep, not a duplicate check.

Skip-safe: exits 0 with a SKIP: message if the mysql connector is
missing or no DB is reachable. The direct-allowlist scenarios need no
reasoning plugin at all; the GENERATE-path section additionally skips
(not fails) if FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN isn't present on this host.
