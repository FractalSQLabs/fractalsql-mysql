    Direct line-by-line translation of build_test.sh, NOT independently
    verified against a real Windows box (this was written and validated
    against a real MySQL 8.4 Linux container; build_test.sh's own
    header/report documents that end-to-end run. This .ps1 has only been
    checked for PowerShell syntax validity where a pwsh interpreter was
    reachable, not run against real mysqld.exe/mysql.exe binaries).
    Treat every claim below as "translated with intent preserved," not
    "confirmed working on Windows" until a real CI run (windows-gate-
    matrix in .github/workflows/build-test.yml) exercises it. A direct
    line-by-line Windows translation of this harness needed multiple real-hardware fixes
    beyond the naive translation (MSVC argv quoting, path-canonicalization
    direction, PowerShell 7.3+ native-stderr-as-terminating-error).
    Expect this port needs an equivalent debugging pass on a real run --
    the newly-added gates below (everything except 01/02/06/11/19) are
    LESS battle tested than those five, which already carried real-run-
    shaped caveats of their own (see each gate's own comments). The
    05/07/08/14-18 group specifically is the newest and least exercised:
    ported in a second pass after 03/04/10/12/13/20-28 landed, using the
    SAME restart-based reasoning-plugin-swap and privilege-grant patterns,
    but with no independent Windows validation of its own beyond that.

    Now covers 01 build, 02 smoke, 03 schema_context, 04 text_to_sql,
    05 evil_overread, 06 crash_recovery, 07 evil_lying_length, 08 authz,
    10 dos_and_injection, 11 scout, 12 soak, 13 vectorizer_embed,
    14 retry, 15 embed, 16 embed_authz, 17 embed_soak, 18 embed_crash,
    19 sfs_bounds, 20 analytics, 21 diversify, 22 vector_tier,
    23 cognition, 24 agents, 25 enterprise (dormant-path),
    26 enterprise_active, 27 enterprise_connect, 28 enterprise_signature,
    29 think (FRACTALSQL_HTTP_THINK* -> FSQL_REASONING_HTTP_THINK* bridge),
    31 sql_agent_savepoint (fractal_sql_agent's auto_execute SAVEPOINT/
    ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT safety net, via a marker-routed mock_llm.py
    reply), 32 new_primitives (the newest analytics/vector-math UDFs:
    change_point_detect, periodogram, state_fingerprint, cycle_detect,
    tda_persistence_diagram, optimize_subset, lp_distance,
    quantize_int8/binary, hamming_distance -- known-answer asserted)
    -- full parity with build_test.sh's DEFAULT_GATES (01-25, 29, 31, and
    32, all of 05/07/08/14-18 included and unconditional there too) plus its
    three opt-in enterprise gates (26-28). Gate 09 (a non-
    superuser SQL-SET privilege-escalation check against a server
    system variable) is intentionally NOT
    ported -- MySQL's FractalSQL reasoning-plugin config is env-var-only, read
    once at mysqld startup, so that whole vulnerability class (a SQL
    statement changing which native code loads into every backend) does
    not exist on this port; see build_test.sh's own comment at the same
    spot for the full reasoning. This file's coverage is a known,
    evolving target, not a claim of permanent parity -- re-diff against
    build_test.sh's own gate_NN_* function list when in doubt.

    Reasoning-tier gates (04, 05, 07, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
    20's fractal_optimize_portfolio audit-log path is community-only so
    needs nothing extra, 23, 24) need the SAME mock-LLM infrastructure
    build_test.sh's mysql_setup wires up: fractalsql-reasoning-http.dll
    copied into the plugin dir, scripts\ci\mock_llm.py started as a
    background process, and FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN/HTTP_URL/
    HTTP_EMBED_URL/HTTP_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT set in mysqld's process
    environment BEFORE it starts (read once, lazily, per process -- same
    as every other FRACTALSQL_* knob on this port). Gates 05/07/08/14/
    15/18 additionally need five more reasoning-VFS-ABI test-fixture
    DLLs (evil_nonterminating, evil_lying_length, evil_crash_reasoning,
    evil_embed, retry_reasoning -- tests\*.c, pure C against the shared
    fractalsql_sql.h with no mysql.h dependency), compiled fresh into
    the plugin dir on every Mysql-Setup call the same way evil_crash.dll
    already was. Swap-ReasoningPlugin/Restore-ReasoningPlugin (restart-
    based, since FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN has no live-reload) are the
    general-purpose helpers gates 05/07/08/14/15/16/18 all use; gate 18
    additionally needs Restart-ReasoningPluginInPlace, a no-datadir-wipe
    variant, since its entire point is proving data survives a real
    crash + in-place respawn (see that function's own comment). None of
    this infrastructure existed in this file before this pass; it
    assumes `python` (falling back to `python3`) is on PATH, which is
    true for GitHub Actions' windows-latest runners but
    NOT independently verified for every possible Windows dev box --
    flagged, not assumed silently.

.PARAMETER MysqlDir
    Path to an extracted MySQL Windows binaries tree (the directory
    containing bin\mysqld.exe, bin\mysql.exe, include\mysql.h --
    MySQL's winx64 zips put mysql.h DIRECTLY under include\).
    Mandatory by design: the caller always names the exact tree under
    test, with no PATH-search fallback to guess wrong silently -- this
    matches this repo's own release.yml build-windows-msi
    job's deps\mysql\root layout (mysql-<VER>-winx64.zip from
    downloads.mysql.com's archives CDN, with the dev.mysql.com
    fallback + UA/PK-magic bot-check release.yml already implements --
    see that workflow's download steps, not re-derived here).

.PARAMETER MysqlMajor
    Target major ("8.4", "9.7", or "26.7" -- the supported matrix this
    repo ships for is the 8.4 LTS + 9.7 LTS + 26.7 floor; 8.0 is EOL
    and excluded). Mandatory, same rationale as -MysqlDir: MysqlDir
    already pins the exact binaries, but every dist\ output path and
    datadir/port/plugin-dir naming below keys off this value, so a
    caller testing against, say, 8.4 binaries can no longer forget to
    pass it and silently get 8.4's binaries labeled and ported as if
    they were 9.7. Nothing keys off the exact label beyond naming
    (build-msi.bat's MAJOR_HEX map is the one downstream consumer that
    enumerates labels), so a 9.7 install passes -MysqlMajor 9.7 and a
    26.7.0 install passes -MysqlMajor 26.7.

.PARAMETER TimeoutMult
    Scales gate 06's respawn-poll budget. Default 1, auto-bumped to 3
    under -Asan/-Ubsan unless passed explicitly.

.PARAMETER VcpkgRoot
    vcpkg install root, for OpenSSL (src\fractalsql_enterprise.c's
    ent_verify_signature() needs openssl/evp.h and libcrypto.lib --
    see scripts\windows\build.bat's own Prerequisites comment for the
    full wolfSSL-vs-OpenSSL rationale). Same convention as
    fractalsql-reasoning-http's scripts\build-windows.ps1 -VcpkgRoot:
    defaults to $env:VCPKG_ROOT / $env:VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT / C:\vcpkg
    (in that order) when omitted. Only read by the plain (non -Asan/
    -Ubsan) build path here (passed through to build.bat via
    $env:VCPKG_ROOT) and by Build-AsanExtension/Build-UbsanExtension's
    own direct cl.exe/clang-cl invocations below.

.PARAMETER Asan
    Rebuilds fractalsql.dll with MSVC /fsanitize=address into a separate
    dist\windows-asan\ tree (never touches the normal dist\windows\
    release output), then runs the same gates against the instrumented
    DLL loaded into mysqld.exe. Only this repo's own SRCS get
    instrumented; the vendored core .lib (include\windows-x86_64\
    fractalsql-*.lib) is linked as-is, not rebuilt -- catches bugs in
    the extension's own glue code but not inside core's own SFS
    algorithm internals. /GL (whole-program optimization, on in the
    normal build) is dropped -- documented MSVC incompatibility with
    /fsanitize=address -- and /LTCG drops with it at link time.
    Mutually exclusive with -Ubsan (each rebuilds its own separate
    dist\ tree, run one at a time).

.PARAMETER Ubsan
    Same structure as -Asan (separate dist\windows-ubsan\ tree, same
    gates run against the instrumented DLL), but via clang-cl (LLVM's
    MSVC-ABI-compatible driver -- native cl.exe has no UBSan support at
    all) and -fsanitize=undefined instead of native cl.exe's
    /fsanitize=address.

.PARAMETER Fuzz
    Gate 30 only -- libFuzzer smoke via clang-cl against
    src\fractalsql_parse.c's 3 hand-rolled parsers (parse_vector_csv,
    parse_corpus, parse_index_csv). No cluster, no extension DLL. Set
    FSQL_FUZZ_TIME (seconds per target, default 30) to run longer than
    the pre-push smoke budget.

.PARAMETER Gate
    Run a single gate by number instead of the default set.

.PARAMETER Quick
    Gates 01, 02 only.
