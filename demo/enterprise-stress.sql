-- demo/enterprise-stress.sql
--
-- Enterprise Tier -- QTL Ledger under stress + tamper-evidence.
--
-- Companion to enterprise-qtl-audit.sql (which walks the functions one
-- call at a time). This demo fills the in-memory Truth/Shadow ledgers to
-- their capacity bound (64 each, FSQL_TRUTH/SHADOW_DEFAULT_CAP in
-- fractalsql-core), churns repeated flush cycles, builds a short
-- append-only chain, and verifies it with fractal_ledger_verify().
--
-- Tamper injection needs a step this file's own SQL cannot take. The
-- ledger is a local file, not a SQL table (see src/fractalsql_
-- enterprise.c's header: MySQL's C UDF ABI has no way for a UDF to run
-- SQL against its own calling session, so there is no `UPDATE
-- fractalsql_ledger SET blob = ...` to reach for -- the CSV mirror is
-- an external, read-only-by-convention read surface).
-- Reaching the bytes means reaching the file, which from inside a MySQL
-- session is only possible via LOAD_FILE()/INTO DUMPFILE (subject to
-- secure_file_priv) or, more directly, a shell open on the container/host.
-- This demo's own SQL runs Phases A-C end to end; Phase D (tamper) is a
-- documented recipe you run against the container's filesystem between
-- two `mysql` invocations, not a single self-contained script the way
-- enterprise-qtl-audit.sql is. Both the structural-truncation and
-- entry-hash-tamper cases below have been run against a real
-- libfractalsql-enterprise-sovereign-c.so; see each Phase D recipe for
-- the resulting output.
--
-- The ledger key (FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_KEY) adds HMAC-SHA256
-- tagging on top of the structural hash chain, so a payload byte-flip
-- that preserves length is caught even though the structural checks
-- alone can't see it (MySQL has
-- no per-session `SET fractalsql.enterprise_ledger_key = ...` to toggle
-- this mid-script: every FractalSQL config knob here is a process
-- environment variable, read once at mysqld startup, see enterprise.md).
-- Testing the HMAC path means starting a container with the key already
-- set; this demo's SQL phases work identically either way and don't
-- depend on which one you're running against.
--
-- Runs cleanly in BOTH states and tells you which:
--   * Enterprise ACTIVE:  Phases A-C run for real against the persisted
--     ledger file.
--   * Enterprise DORMANT: the first ledger call returns NULL and the
--     demo prints a single notice explaining the surface is
--     enterprise-only. Community search is unaffected.
--
-- Safe to re-run: the in-memory ledger context is per-session (a fresh
-- connection starts empty), but the PERSISTED ledger is process-global
-- and accumulates across runs -- each phase below calls
-- fractal_ledger_reset_hard() first so a re-run's counts stay
-- predictable even though the underlying file keeps growing.

-- =====================================================================
-- Phase D: tamper-evidence recipes (out-of-band, not run by this script)
-- =====================================================================
--
-- Both recipes below target FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_PATH (default
-- fractalsql_ledger.dat, relative to mysqld's cwd -- the datadir root in
-- the official Docker image, /var/lib/mysql/fractalsql_ledger.dat). Run
-- the recipe, then re-run `SELECT fractal_ledger_verify(CONNECTION_ID());`
-- in a NEW `mysql` invocation (fractal_ledger_verify reads the file
-- fresh every call, no caching, so no restart is needed for this part).
--
-- --- D1: structural truncation -------------------------------------
-- Cuts the file below the file header (9 bytes: 8-byte magic + 1-byte
-- version), so the very next read fails immediately.
--
--   docker compose exec mysql bash -c \
--     'truncate -s 5 /var/lib/mysql/fractalsql_ledger.dat'
--
-- fractal_ledger_verify() then returns
--   {"ok":false,"first_failure_id":0,"reason":"bad ledger file header"}
--
-- Not self-healing: fractal_ledger_write_entry opens an existing file
-- with fopen(path, "r+b") and refuses to write if the header it finds
-- doesn't match, rather than falling back to starting a fresh file. A
-- truncated-to-a-bad-header ledger stays stuck (fractal_ledger_flush()
-- itself also returns NULL after this, not just fractal_ledger_verify())
-- until the file is deleted --
--   docker compose exec mysql rm -f /var/lib/mysql/fractalsql_ledger.dat
-- starts a genuinely fresh chain on the next flush.
--
-- --- D2: entry-hash tamper (flips a byte in an EARLIER record, not the
-- tip) --------------------------------------------------------------
-- Demonstrates the same O(1)-tip-only vs O(n)-full-walk boundary
-- fractal_ledger_load()/fractal_ledger_verify() document elsewhere:
-- fractal_ledger_load() only re-derives the chain tip on its own O(1)
-- check, so a tampered EARLIER record doesn't block it; only
-- fractal_ledger_verify()'s full walk catches it. Run this right after
-- Phase C above so there are at least 3 kind=1 records to pick from.
--
--   docker compose exec mysql python3 -c "
--   import struct
--   path = '/var/lib/mysql/fractalsql_ledger.dat'
--   with open(path, 'rb') as f: data = bytearray(f.read())
--   pos = 9  # past the 8-byte magic + 1-byte version file header
--   first_blob_off = None
--   while pos < len(data):
--       kind, blen = struct.unpack_from('<II', data, pos)
--       if kind == 1 and first_blob_off is None:
--           first_blob_off = pos + 116  # past this record's fixed header
--       pos += 116 + blen
--   data[first_blob_off] ^= 0xFF
--   with open(path, 'wb') as f: f.write(data)
--   "
--
-- Result:
--   fractal_ledger_load(CONNECTION_ID())     -> still succeeds (tip-only)
--   fractal_ledger_verify(CONNECTION_ID())   ->
--     {"ok":false,"first_failure_id":1,"reason":"entry_hash mismatch (structural tamper)"}
--
-- --- D3: HMAC-authenticated tamper (needs FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_KEY
-- set when the container/mysqld STARTED -- MySQL has no per-session
-- server system variable to set this mid-script) -------------------------
-- With a ledger key configured, every entry also carries an HMAC-SHA256
-- tag (see enterprise.md). D2's byte-flip recipe above, run against a
-- keyed ledger, is caught by the MAC even in cases a pure structural
-- check might miss (e.g. a flip that happens to preserve blen and the
-- recomputed structural hash coincidentally -- astronomically unlikely
-- for SHA-256, but the MAC is the actual cryptographic guarantee, the
-- hash chain alone is only tamper-EVIDENT, not tamper-PROOF, against a
-- motivated attacker who can also rewrite entry_hash itself). With
-- FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_KEY set at container start,
-- fractal_ledger_verify() reports
--   {"ok":false,"first_failure_id":1,"reason":"HMAC mismatch"}
-- for the same D2 recipe once every entry carries a MAC.
