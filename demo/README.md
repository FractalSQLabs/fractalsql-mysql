# FractalSQL demo

`demo.sql` is a runnable, five-minute walkthrough of search and
reasoning in one script: Sniper Search, Scout Discovery, and LLM
reasoning — including Scout's output feeding straight into a reasoning
call, which is the pattern the rest of the docs point at but don't show
running end to end in one place. Text-to-SQL has its own walkthrough —
see [Text-to-SQL](#text-to-sql) below.

`response-modes.sql` is a companion script for `text` / `code` / `json`
response modes — see [Response modes](#response-modes) below for why
it's a separate file from `demo.sql`.

## Prerequisites

1. **The UDFs are registered.** MySQL has no `CREATE EXTENSION`; the
   equivalent is running the install scripts once:

   ```sh
   mysql -u root -p < sql/install_udf.sql
   mysql -u root -p < sql/install_agents.sql   -- for demo-agents.sql
   ```

2. **Reasoning is configured.** Sections 0–2 of `demo.sql` only need the
   UDFs themselves, but sections 3–4 call `fractal_reason()`, which
   needs a working LLM endpoint. Follow
   [../docs/reasoning-setup.md](../docs/reasoning-setup.md) first —
   Ollama, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, GCP Vertex, and any
   OpenAI-compatible endpoint are all documented there, and
   `docker compose up -d` sets the whole thing up for you (see
   [docs/docker-demo.md](../docs/docker-demo.md)). Config is a set of
   `FRACTALSQL_*` process environment variables read ONCE by `mysqld`
   at startup — there is no server config file, sysvar, or `SET GLOBAL`
   equivalent. Confirm it works before running this demo:

   ```sql
   SELECT fractal_reason(CONNECTION_ID(), 'reply with a short confirmation that this connection works');
   ```

   If that returns NULL or errors, `demo.sql` will hit the same error
   at section 3 — fix it there first rather than debugging through the
   demo script.

## Running it

```sh
mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/demo.sql
```

The mysql CLI has no per-statement timing toggle; wrap a call in
`SET profiling = 1; ... SHOW PROFILES;` if you want per-statement
timing — worth watching, since the reasoning calls (sections 3–4) are
the slow part. A cloud endpoint typically responds in a few seconds; a
local Ollama model can take much longer on a cold load (see "Handling
Constrained Hardware" in `docs/reasoning-setup.md` if a call times
out).

The script is safe to re-run: `demo_alerts` and `demo_embeddings` are
dropped and recreated at the start of their sections every time, so
there's no stale-state cleanup to do between runs.

## What each section shows

- **0 — Sanity check.** `fractal_edition()` / `fractal_version()`
  confirm the UDFs are actually registered before anything else runs.
- **1 — Setup.** A small `demo_alerts` table with a deliberate story in
  it: a login-attempt count that escalates (3 → 3 → 17) and a latency
  spike in the last ~10 minutes. Nothing here calls the LLM yet.
- **2 — Sniper Search.** `fractal_search()` converges to a single best
  point for a query vector — the fast, precise mode. No table needed;
  it operates on the query vector alone.
- **3 — Reasoning over real data.** `fractal_reason()` gets a real
  `context` argument this time — the alerts from the last hour,
  serialized to JSON via a subquery — rather than an empty ping. Expect
  the model to notice the login-attempt escalation and the latency
  spike; exact wording varies by model and provider.
- **4 — Scout Discovery feeding reasoning.** `fractal_search_explore()`
  samples a diversity-spread population from `demo_embeddings`, and
  that population is handed to `fractal_reason()` as context in the
  same statement. This is the differentiator pattern: diversity-sampled
  context instead of a plain `WHERE` filter, in one pipeline.

## Response modes

`response-modes.sql` demonstrates `FSQL_REASONING_HTTP_RESPONSE_MODE`
(`text` / `code` / `json`) — see
[docs/reasoning-setup.md](../docs/reasoning-setup.md#response-modes) for
the full explanation.

It's a **separate file from `demo.sql`**, not another section in it,
because the response mode is env-var-only and read once when the
plugin initializes — changing it needs an OS-level environment change
plus a full `mysqld` restart, which a single `mysql <` script
can't do to itself mid-run. Run it as three manual passes instead:

1. Run `demo.sql` first if you haven't — `response-modes.sql` reuses
   its `demo_alerts` table.
2. For each mode (`text` needs no setup — it's the default):
   1. Set `FSQL_REASONING_HTTP_RESPONSE_MODE` and restart `mysqld`.
      See [docs/reasoning-setup.md](../docs/reasoning-setup.md) for the
      exact commands on your platform.
   2. Run only that section's query from `response-modes.sql` (copy it
      into the `mysql` client, or pipe just that section) — not the
      whole file.

What to expect: `code` mode returns a bare SQL statement with no
prose wrapper (no "Here's a query that does that:" preamble, no
visible fence markers). `json` mode returns text that survives a
`CAST(... AS JSON)` — the script's own query includes that cast, so a
successful result is proof the plugin's extraction and validation
actually worked, not just "looks like JSON."

## Enterprise Tier — QTL & CISO Audit

`enterprise-qtl-audit.sql` exercises the enterprise-tier **Quantized Ternary
Ledger** (append-only, tamper-evident Truth/Shadow record of search/feedback
events, persisted as a hash-chained file in the datadir) and **CISO audit
unpack** surface. Unlike every other demo here, it runs cleanly in **two**
states and tells you which one it found:

- **Dormant (default):** the enterprise core library is not loaded, so
  the nine functions (eight `fractal_ledger_*` functions plus
  `fractal_audit_unpack`) are registered but inactive. The demo seeds
  real engagement events with the community `fractal_feedback_report()`
  primitive, then the first enterprise call comes back `NULL` and the
  demo prints a single `Enterprise tier not loaded` notice explaining
  how to activate it. It exits successfully — safe to run on a
  community-only checkout or in CI.
- **Active:** with the enterprise shared library staged in and
  `FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LIB` pointed at it (a `mysqld` restart), the
  demo flushes the seeded ledgers to the real ledger file via the
  file-backed storage path, decodes the persisted QTL blob back into a
  CISO event log with `fractal_audit_unpack()`, then exercises `load` /
  `compact` / `reset_soft` / `reset_hard` end to end.

```sh
mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/enterprise-qtl-audit.sql
```

See the [Enterprise Tier](../README.md#enterprise-tier) section of the
root README and [docs/enterprise.md](../docs/enterprise.md) for the
activation steps and the function reference. The ledger's CSV mirror is
an external read surface (MySQL has no CONNECT storage engine for an
in-server mirror table) — decode its entries with any CSV-capable tool
and feed a blob back through `fractal_audit_unpack`.

### Enterprise Tier — Stress & Tamper-Evidence

`enterprise-stress.sql` is the companion to the audit demo above: it
hammers the same enterprise ledger surface under load. Phases A–C run
end to end: it fills the in-memory Truth/Shadow ledgers to their
**capacity bound** (64 each, `FSQL_TRUTH/SHADOW_DEFAULT_CAP` — 128
events total with disjoint doc_ids; beyond 64 of either kind the ledger
evicts the lowest-weight entry, so 64/64 is the real cap), churns
**5 flush/load cycles at capacity**, and builds a short 3-link
append-only chain, each verified by `fractal_ledger_verify`.
**Phase D — tamper-evidence** is documented in the script's header
comment as out-of-band recipes rather than run in-script (MySQL's C
UDF ABI has no way for a UDF to flip a byte mid-script): structurally
(truncating the persisted ledger file below its 9-byte header, rejected
by the record-length walk) and cryptographically (setting
`FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_KEY` to HMAC-SHA256-tag every record and
flipping a middle payload byte the structural check cannot see, rejected
by the MAC on load). Same dual-state, safe-on-community shape as the
audit demo (dormant → single notice; active → all phases run clean).

> **Scope note:** by default (`FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_KEY` unset)
> the QTL format carries no MAC, so the tamper-evidence demonstrated is
> **structural only** (truncation / count-length mismatch). A targeted
> payload byte-flip (e.g. changing a stored `doc_id`) is **not** detected
> by the structural check. Setting `FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_KEY` (an
> environment variable read once at `mysqld` startup) adds an
> **HMAC-SHA256 envelope**: every flush tags the persisted record and
> every load verifies the tag before the core decodes, so that same
> byte-flip **is** detected.
>
> **Cross-restart / tamper coverage** (flush on one `mysqld` lifetime,
> load rehydrating the ledger in a fresh one, and a byte-level payload
> tamper caught by the MAC on load) is exercised by `build_test` **gate
> 26** — not something a single `mysql <` script can do to itself.

```sh
mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/enterprise-stress.sql
```

## Text-to-SQL

`demo-text-to-sql.sql` walks through `fractal_text_to_sql()` against
a richer three-table schema with real foreign keys (`customers` ->
`orders` -> `order_items`) — single-table questions, a question
requiring a join, and a question requiring all three tables, plus
capturing and running a generated statement yourself. Same
prerequisites as `demo.sql` (UDFs registered, reasoning configured).
Full pipeline explanation, the allowlist reference, and the
execution-role grant pattern are in
[docs/text-to-sql-setup.md](../docs/text-to-sql-setup.md).

```sh
mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/demo-text-to-sql.sql
```

`demo/text-to-sql-spike-*.sql` are a 4-part hand-rolled GENERATE →
REVIEW → EXPLAIN → negative-control validation spike, kept as the
record of how the function was validated before it shipped — history,
not the recommended starting point. Reasoning config is fixed per
`mysqld` process: restart with a different `FRACTALSQL_HTTP_MODEL`
to compare a different model, then re-run Parts 1–4 from scratch.

## Industry vertical demos

Thirteen runnable walkthroughs — ten **industry verticals** and three
**agentic verticals** — each with its own synthetic dataset and its own
subset of the function surface chosen for genuine domain fit, not forced
coverage. Every one ends with a `fractal_reason()` narrative call over
real computed results, same closing pattern as `demo.sql`. Same
prerequisites as `demo.sql` (UDFs registered; the final reasoning
section in each needs [reasoning configured](../docs/reasoning-setup.md)
— every earlier section runs without it; the two newest kits,
Biotech & Genomics and Edge Swarm, need no reasoning at all (see their
entries below)). All thirteen are also wired
into the Docker demo — see
[the Learning Path](../docs/docker-demo.md#the-learning-path).
Four (MedTech, Maritime, Fleet, Cybersecurity) store their vector
columns via this repo's two native paths — the portable
JSON-array-string `TEXT` column (works on all three supported floors,
8.4 LTS / 9.7 LTS / 26.7) or MySQL 9.7/26.7 Community's own `VECTOR(n)`
type — picking one per column rather than a 1:1
type substitution; see [demo-fractal-vector.sql](demo-fractal-vector.sql)
and [docs/vectorizer-setup.md](../docs/vectorizer-setup.md) for the
type story.

```sh
mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/demo-vertical-quant-finance.sql
```

- **[demo-vertical-quant-finance.sql](demo-vertical-quant-finance.sql)** —
  Quantitative Finance & Algorithmic Trading. A 25-asset factor-model
  portfolio (`fractal_optimize_portfolio` picks the best 8) and a
  300-point price series with a deliberate volatility regime change at
  t=150 (`fractal_dimension_dfa`/`fractal_dimension_drift`).
  `fractal_search_trajectory` finds which of 10 historical quarterly
  rebalances the new allocation most resembles.
- **[demo-vertical-medtech-clinical.sql](demo-vertical-medtech-clinical.sql)** —
  MedTech, Clinical Telemetry & Patient Monitoring. 40 synthetic
  patients with a fixed five-field clinical vitals vector where
  dimension-drift protection actually matters:
  `fractal_hybrid_clinical_search` over an age/condition cohort computed
  with ordinary SQL, `fractal_search_trajectory` for a patient's current
  vitals vs. their own admission baseline, plus the domain-geometry
  functions (`fractal_vascular_network`, `fractal_cortical_folding`,
  `fractal_nerve_plexus_metric`) on small, pre-extracted geometric
  fixtures — a vessel graph, a reference unit-cube mesh, a nerve fiber
  skeleton.
- **[demo-vertical-recommendation-search.sql](demo-vertical-recommendation-search.sql)** —
  Advanced Recommendation, Search & Discovery Engines. A 300-item, 6-genre
  catalog for diverse "you might also like" discovery
  (`fractal_search_explore`), table-backed top-k
  (`fractal_search_telemetry`), and the **full stateful-diversity
  loop**: enable Diversify, search, report negative feedback on the
  top result, re-search the same query, confirm it's now avoided — the
  real differentiator over plain top-K or MMR, neither of which is
  stateful across searches. Also covers `fractal_cross_modal_search`
  (content + behavior vectors, weighted).
- **[demo-vertical-sovereign-edge-ai.sql](demo-vertical-sovereign-edge-ai.sql)** —
  Sovereign, Edge & Autonomous Systems AI. FractalSQL's whole story fits
  this vertical natively — search, reasoning, and optimization all run
  as pure C UDFs inside the same `mysqld` process, no external
  vector-DB service required. A 50-node edge-compute fleet: Sniper
  Search for an ideal node profile, Scout Discovery for diverse fleet
  profiles, `fractal_dimension_boxcount` over a facility deployment
  grid, and `fractal_optimize_portfolio` repurposed as a general
  on-device black-box resource allocator (picking 6-of-50 nodes for a
  distributed job under contention risk).
- **[demo-vertical-maritime-defense.sql](demo-vertical-maritime-defense.sql)** —
  Maritime, Aviation & Defense (AIS & Radar Tracking). 30 synthetic AIS
  vessel tracks (a fixed four-field track-state vector), one given a
  deliberate course deviation. `fractal_search_trajectory` on the
  current-vs-baseline track delta (a direct fit for "what changed"
  deviation detection), nearest-track/diverse-track clustering
  across the fleet, and `fractal_dimension_dfa` on heading-change
  series to separate smooth transit from erratic maneuvering.
- **[demo-vertical-fleet-logistics.sql](demo-vertical-fleet-logistics.sql)** —
  Autonomous Fleet Management & Last-Mile Delivery. A 40-vehicle
  delivery fleet, one running a deliberate detour. Diverse route/zone
  clustering for depot coverage, a cohort-restricted search ("today's
  route-3 vehicles only" — the same cohort-then-search composition
  `fractal_hybrid_clinical_search` uses, built here with an ordinary
  filtered table instead of that clinically-named function), detour
  detection via `fractal_search_trajectory`, and GPS-trace complexity
  via `fractal_dimension_boxcount`.
- **[demo-vertical-smart-cities-iot.sql](demo-vertical-smart-cities-iot.sql)** —
  Smart Cities & IoT Sensor Grids. A 400-sensor city grid
  (traffic/air-quality/noise): spatial coverage diagnostics
  (`fractal_dimension_boxcount`/`fractal_morphological_complexity`),
  an air-quality event detected via `fractal_dimension_dfa`/
  `fractal_dimension_drift` on a sensor series with a deliberate
  regime shift, and diverse representative-zone sampling via Scout
  Discovery.
- **[demo-vertical-cybersecurity-threat-detection.sql](demo-vertical-cybersecurity-threat-detection.sql)** —
  Cybersecurity & Threat Detection (network behavior analytics). A
  35-host fleet across three zones, one host showing a stealthy
  compromise pattern — outbound connections, destination ports, and DNS
  query volume all spike while failed-auth stays flat, not a brute-force
  signature. Diverse traffic-profile clustering for threat hunting
  (`fractal_search_explore`), a zone-restricted search ("DMZ hosts
  only" — the same cohort-then-search composition
  `fractal_hybrid_clinical_search` uses), compromise detection via
  `fractal_search_trajectory`, and connection-rate regime-change
  detection via `fractal_dimension_dfa`/`fractal_dimension_drift` on a
  beaconing-onset series.
- **[demo-vertical-biotech-genomics.sql](demo-vertical-biotech-genomics.sql)** —
  Biotech & Genomics (structural bioinformatics / single-cell
  transcriptomics). Two showcases for the newest primitives:
  `fractal_tda_persistence_diagram` over a PCA/UMAP-reduced-style point
  cloud standing in for a cell-cycle trajectory that loops back on
  itself (G1 → S → G2/M → G1), where topological data analysis is a
  real, published technique for detecting exactly this kind of cyclic
  structure in single-cell data; and `fractal_vector_lp_distance`
  comparing synthetic gene-expression profiles under L1 (Manhattan,
  the more standard genomics choice) vs the extension's default L2,
  with the demo narrative explaining *why* they disagree. Needs no
  reasoning at all. Carries the TDA scope note (betti1 is the 1-skeleton
  cycle rank, not full homology) from the install script verbatim.
- **[demo-vertical-agentic-edge-swarm.sql](demo-vertical-agentic-edge-swarm.sql)** —
  Agentic Edge Swarms (many small autonomous agents coordinating under
  tight memory/battery/bandwidth budgets). Three showcases for the same
  operating envelope: `fractal_vector_quantize_int8`/`_binary` +
  `fractal_vector_hamming_distance` compressing a swarm agent's local
  observation memory 4x/32x, `fractal_state_fingerprint` +
  `fractal_cycle_detect` catching an agent stuck in a "cognitive
  wobble" period-2 loop with O(1) memory per step, and
  `fractal_optimize_subset` doing battery-constrained task routing.
  Despite the "agentic" name it exercises the primitives directly, not
  the agent procedures, so it needs no reasoning at all.

One genuine architectural constraint applies to two of the above:
The information_schema catalog has zero visibility into `TEMPORARY`
tables, so `demo-vertical-fleet-logistics.sql` and
`demo-vertical-cybersecurity-threat-detection.sql` use a plain
permanent `CREATE TABLE` for their cohort tables
(`vfl_route3_cohort`/`vcy_dmz_cohort`) rather than `CREATE TEMPORARY
TABLE` — a temporary table can't be introspected that way.

### Agentic verticals (Universal Agent composition)

The three agentic verticals exercise the C-level **Universal Agents**
(`fractal_agent_detect_loop`, `fractal_agent_plan_explore`,
`fractal_agent_trajectory_predict` — installed as ordinary stored
procedures in this edition) composed into **Domain Agents** — see
[docs/api-agency.md](../docs/api-agency.md) for the composition
pattern. Unlike the domain verticals above, every section here needs
reasoning configured (the agents call `fractal_reason`/`fractal_embed`),
and each is a clean, re-runnable regression test of a recently-fixed
agent code path — nothing commented out, no skip-wrappers.

- **[demo-vertical-agentic-ops-devops.sql](demo-vertical-agentic-ops-devops.sql)** —
  DevOps/SRE: Autonomous Incident Triage & Self-Healing. The
  embed-coupled agents on a real vectorized `vao_incident_logs` corpus:
  `fractal_search_agent` and `fractal_rag_agent` (a question embedded
  and Scout-searched over the embedded log lines, with and without the
  reasoning step), `fractal_agent_detect_loop` on a period-2
  state-hash array (the short-period check the DFA-only threshold
  misses), drift analysis over a real latency series, plus
  `fractal_agent_route_task` and `fractal_agent_outlier_intercept`
  Domain Agent compositions.
- **[demo-vertical-agentic-fintech-mcts.sql](demo-vertical-agentic-fintech-mcts.sql)** —
  FinTech: Scenario Exploration & Safe Execution. `fractal_agent_plan_explore`
  over a vectorized `vfm_trade_strategies` corpus (the embed-coupling
  satisfied by the vectorizer), text-to-SQL-driven execution with a
  thrown error surfaced as a clean failure row rather than aborting the
  call, and `fractal_optimize_portfolio` rebalancing.
- **[demo-vertical-agentic-customer-support.sql](demo-vertical-agentic-customer-support.sql)** —
  Customer Support: Stateful Session & Churn Drift.
  `fractal_agent_trajectory_predict` reading a baseline + latest state
  vector by PK and deriving the drift from the data itself, plus
  `fractal_agent_recall_hybrid`, `fractal_agent_recommend_diverse`, and
  the `fractal_diversify_enable` stateful-diversity loop.

**A note on `fractal_dimension_boxcount`/`fractal_morphological_complexity`
fixture design**, visible across several of the scripts above: both
functions need enough *space-filling* points (a grid, a path, a real
geometric structure) for the internal box-counting estimator to work —
`fractal_dimension_boxcount`'s documented "≥ 8 points and a
non-degenerate bounding box" is *necessary, not sufficient* (500
uniform-random 2-D points succeeded in testing, 64 did not), and a
sparse or purely random scatter, even well past that minimum, can fail
it and return `NULL` rather than a wrong number. Every fixture above
was chosen and verified against a live server with that requirement in
mind.

## The sixteen agents

`demo-agents.sql` validates the sixteen installable agents shipped in
`sql/install_agents.sql` — the productized, callable form of the Domain
Agent reference blueprints plus generalized agents that cover the
vertical demo sections the blueprints don't cover (see
[docs/api-agency.md](../docs/api-agency.md) for which agent to use).
MySQL has no extension-dependency system, so the agents are plain
stored procedures called as `CALL fractal_agent_<name>(..., @result)`.
It exercises all sixteen end-to-end:

- **`fractal_agent_anomaly_triage`** — over a drifting latency series (real
  `fractal_dimension_drift` → real `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_allocate`** — on a real `mu`/`cov` (real
  `fractal_optimize_portfolio` → real `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_route_task`** — matches a task embedding to the nearest
  capability row (real `fractal_search_telemetry` → real `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_outlier_intercept`** — screens a state vector against known
  bad states and compares the real nearest-distance to a threshold (real
  `fractal_search_telemetry` → real `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_recall_hybrid`** — vector recall restricted by a metadata
  cohort (real `fractal_hybrid_clinical_search`); pure retrieval, no LLM step.
- **`fractal_agent_recommend_diverse`** — repulsion-diverse top-k over a catalog
  (real `fractal_diversify_enable` + real `fractal_search_telemetry`); pure
  retrieval, no LLM step.
- **`fractal_agent_data_analyst`** — a natural-language question over your
  tables (real text-to-SQL with execution → real `fractal_reason`); the
  horizontal catch-all with no vertical preset.
- **`fractal_agent_patient_deterioration_triage`** — cohort-restricted
  nearest patient + baseline→current drift (real
  `fractal_hybrid_clinical_search` + real `fractal_search_trajectory` →
  real `fractal_reason`); the cohort is caller-built so `age>65 AND
  condition='sepsis'` composes in ordinary SQL.
- **`fractal_agent_feedback_audit`** — a self-contained diversify/repulsion
  audit cycle (real collapse detection + real `fractal_explain_result`);
  pure analytics, **no LLM**, self-disables diversify.
- **`fractal_agent_schedule_workload`** — refines a task vector then finds
  the nearest node (real `fractal_search` + real `fractal_search_telemetry`
  → real `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_rebalance_sibling`** — optimized book vs nearest
  historical allocation (real `fractal_optimize_portfolio` + real
  `fractal_search_trajectory` → real `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_diverse_portfolios`** — enterprise tier; companion to
  `fractal_agent_allocate` returning several structurally distinct good
  portfolios instead of one (real `fractal_optimize_portfolio_multimodal`
  → real `fractal_reason`); dormant on community, exception-guarded so
  the demo still completes cleanly.
- **`fractal_agent_detour_classify`** — route deviation + GPS-trace
  complexity (real `fractal_search_trajectory` + real
  `fractal_dimension_boxcount` → real `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_track_anomaly`** — track deviation + heading DFA (real
  `fractal_search_trajectory` + real `fractal_dimension_dfa` → real
  `fractal_reason`).
- **`fractal_agent_network_coverage_alert`** — sensor-grid morphology +
  telemetry drift (real `fractal_morphological_complexity` + real
  `fractal_dimension_drift` → real `fractal_reason`); 20×20 grid (400 pts).
- **`fractal_agent_regime_triage`** — single-series regime change (real
  `fractal_dimension_dfa` + real `fractal_dimension_drift` → real
  `fractal_reason`).

The three Universal Agent primitives above (`detect_loop`,
`plan_explore`, `trajectory_predict`) are installed alongside them as
procedures too — the agentic verticals exercise those; `demo-agents.sql`
covers the sixteen.

Thirteen agents are cognition (end in `fractal_reason`); three are pure
retrieval/analytics with no endpoint needed (`recall_hybrid`,
`recommend_diverse`, `feedback_audit`). The script closes with a
`fractal_reason()` narrative over the computed results — same closing
pattern as every other demo.

**Prerequisites:** in addition to the base UDFs and reasoning (same as
`demo.sql`), register the agent procedures:

```sh
mysql -u root -p < sql/install_udf.sql          -- prerequisite (already done for demo.sql)
mysql -u root -p < sql/install_agents.sql       -- the agent procedures
```

```sh
mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/demo-agents.sql
```

The script is safe to re-run: `agents_demo_logs` and the agent fixture
tables (`agents_demo_caps`, `agents_demo_badstates`, `agents_demo_mem`,
`agents_demo_catalog`, `agents_demo_data`, `agents_demo_patients`,
`agents_demo_fcatalog`/`agents_demo_fwarmup`, `agents_demo_nodes`,
`agents_demo_alloc`, `agents_demo_vehicles`, `agents_demo_tracks`) are
dropped and recreated at the top of their sections. The eight
non-agentic vertical demos (`demo-vertical-quant-finance.sql`,
`demo-vertical-medtech-clinical.sql`, `demo-vertical-recommendation-search.sql`,
`demo-vertical-sovereign-edge-ai.sql`, `demo-vertical-maritime-defense.sql`,
`demo-vertical-fleet-logistics.sql`, `demo-vertical-smart-cities-iot.sql`,
`demo-vertical-cybersecurity-threat-detection.sql`) are likewise presets —
each rewired section keeps its raw-primitive call as a commented blueprint
above the shipped agent call that generalizes it (the 3 agentic vertical
reference blueprints — `demo-vertical-agentic-ops-devops.sql`,
`demo-vertical-agentic-fintech-mcts.sql`,
`demo-vertical-agentic-customer-support.sql` — stay untouched).
The agent procedures themselves are only dropped by re-running
`sql/install_agents.sql` (see [Cleanup](#cleanup)).

## Full API benchmark

`benchmark-api-reference.sql` is a coverage pass exercising the
callable UDF surface, grouped by category, against small generated
fixtures — a correctness-plus-latency smoke pass over the whole API
surface, distinct from [`benchmark.sql`](benchmark.sql)'s narrower
Sniper-Search/Scout-Discovery/vectorizer-throughput comparison (which
stays scoped to that, see its own header comment). Reasoning-dependent
calls (`fractal_reason`, `fractal_text_to_sql`, `fractal_embed`) are
wrapped in a generic `bmk_safe_call()` helper so a missing or
misconfigured reasoning/embedding endpoint degrades that one row
instead of aborting the rest of the benchmark.

```sh
mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/benchmark-api-reference.sql
```

## Cleanup

The demo tables are left in place after running so you can poke at the
results. Drop them when you're done:

```sql
DROP TABLE demo_alerts, demo_embeddings;
DROP TABLE order_items, orders, customers;                            -- demo-text-to-sql.sql

## Troubleshooting

- **Section 0 fails** — the UDFs aren't registered in this database.
  Re-run `sql/install_udf.sql` (and `sql/install_agents.sql` for
  `demo-agents.sql`). See [../docs/getting-started.md](../docs/getting-started.md).
- **Section 3 or 4 fails** — reasoning isn't configured, or the endpoint
  is unreachable/misconfigured. See the Troubleshooting section in
  [../docs/reasoning-setup.md](../docs/reasoning-setup.md) — it covers
  the specific failure shapes you'll see (plugin not loaded, HTTP 401,
  timeout, non-2xx response) and what each one means.
- **The reasoning response reads oddly** (e.g. the model asks for data
  instead of describing it) — check that the `context` subquery in that
  section actually returned rows. An empty or NULL context still gets
  sent as `'{}'`, and the model's default system prompt explicitly
  expects "database search results" to analyze; with nothing there, it
  will say so rather than hallucinate an answer.
- **An enterprise-tier call returning `NULL` with no error** — this is
  the correct, documented dormant-state behavior when
  `FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LIB` isn't set or the library didn't load, not
  a bug. See [docs/enterprise.md](../docs/enterprise.md).
