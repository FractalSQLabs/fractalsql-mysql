--
-- This extension ships two ways to store a vector: MySQL 9.7
-- Community's own VECTOR(n)/STRING_TO_VECTOR()/VECTOR_TO_STRING()
-- native type (see test_vector_type.py) alongside a portable JSON path:
--   * Portable path (works on all three supported majors, 8.4 LTS /
--     9.7 LTS / 26.7): fractal_vector
--     is a JSON-array-string (sql/install_udf.sql). No custom SQL
--     type, no type modifiers, no operators, every vector operation is a
--     plain function call, which Section 5 below exercises.
--     fractal_vector_scale(vec, factor) exists too (the
--     scalar-multiply equivalent), see sql/install_udf.sql.
--   * Native path (MySQL 9.7 LTS / 26.7 Community, not 8.4 LTS): wrap any fractal_vector_*
--     result in STRING_TO_VECTOR() to store it in a real VECTOR(n) column
--     (dimension enforced by MySQL itself, a hard error on
--     mismatch, see test_vector_type.py Scenario 3), or
--     VECTOR_TO_STRING() a native column straight into these
--     functions. This file sticks to the portable JSON path throughout,
--     since it must run on the full 8.4 LTS / 9.7 LTS / 26.7 compat floor (8.4 LTS
--     has no VECTOR type at all). See docs/vectorizer-setup.md and
--     sql/install_udf.sql's own comment block for the native-path
--     worked example.
-- Sections 1 and 3 (dimension enforcement) and 6 (storage comparison)
-- are kept as portable-path CHECK-constraint / JSON demos below rather
-- than pretending a type modifier exists, matching what's real.

-- === Section 1: dimension enforcement, portable path ===
-- No type modifiers on the portable JSON path. Dimension checking is an
-- explicit CHECK constraint (MySQL 8.0.16+), evaluated with
-- JSON_LENGTH(embedding) = <expected> on every insert/update, not part
-- of the column's declared type the way MySQL 9.7 Community's own
-- native VECTOR(n) is (see header).

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS docs_fv;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS docs_fv_float8;

CREATE TABLE docs_fv (
    id        INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    body      TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding JSON
) COMMENT = 'Same shape as demo/demo-vectorizer.sql''s docs table, no distinct fractal_vector type on the portable path, see header note';

INSERT INTO docs_fv (body) VALUES
    ('FractalSQL runs Stochastic Fractal Search directly inside MySQL.'),
    ('The reasoning plugin speaks the OpenAI chat-completions and embeddings shapes.');

SELECT id, body FROM docs_fv ORDER BY id;

-- === Section 2: create the vectorizer, exactly like the float8[] demo ===
-- fractal_vectorizer_create/_process_queue are PROCEDURES (trailing
-- OUT params / a plain result set respectively), not scalar functions.
-- Drop any leftover fractal_vectorizers row from a previous run first.
-- DROP TABLE docs_fv above already destroyed the trigger-backed table
-- itself, but NOT the vectorizer's own catalog row, which
-- fractal_vectorizer_create() refuses to duplicate (this file's own
-- closing comment claims re-runnability; this is what actually makes
-- that true).
DELETE FROM fractal_vectorizers WHERE source_table = 'docs_fv';
ALTER TABLE fractal_vectorizers AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;   -- demo determinism: pins @vzid = 1 so the literal trigger DDL below matches it
-- MySQL error 1295: CREATE TRIGGER is not a PREPARE target, so
-- fractal_vectorizer_create() returns the trigger DDL instead of
-- running it (see sql/install_udf.sql). In production, run the two
-- returned statements as-is; this scripted demo installs the
-- equivalent triggers literally:
CALL fractal_vectorizer_create('docs_fv', 'body', 'embedding', NULL, @vzid, @ins_trg_sql, @upd_trg_sql);
SELECT @vzid AS vectorizer_id, @ins_trg_sql AS ins_trigger_sql, @upd_trg_sql AS upd_trigger_sql;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS `_fsql_vec_1_ins`;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS `_fsql_vec_1_upd`;
CREATE TRIGGER `_fsql_vec_1_ins` AFTER INSERT ON `docs_fv` FOR EACH ROW CALL _fractalsql_vectorizer_enqueue(1, NEW.`id`);
CREATE TRIGGER `_fsql_vec_1_upd` AFTER UPDATE ON `docs_fv` FOR EACH ROW CALL _fractalsql_vectorizer_enqueue_changed(1, NEW.`id`, OLD.`body`, NEW.`body`);
CALL fractal_vectorizer_process_queue(100, 600);

SELECT id, body, embedding IS NOT NULL AS has_embedding,
       JSON_LENGTH(embedding) AS dim
FROM docs_fv
ORDER BY id;

-- === Section 3: the hard-fail, live (portable path, CHECK constraint) ===
-- No type modifiers on the portable JSON path. The equivalent guarantee is
-- an explicit CHECK constraint. docs_fv's own embedding column is left
-- unconstrained deliberately: its real dimension depends on whatever
-- embedding model the vectorizer above actually called (768 for
-- nomic-embed-text, a different width for another model/provider), so
-- a demo hardcoding one dimension against that live column would break
-- the moment someone points this file at a different endpoint. A
-- SEPARATE small fixture table demonstrates the CHECK mechanism itself
-- against a fixed, known dimension instead:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS docs_fv_dimcheck;
CREATE TABLE docs_fv_dimcheck (
    id        INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    embedding JSON,
    CONSTRAINT chk_docs_fv_dimcheck_dim3 CHECK (embedding IS NULL OR JSON_LENGTH(embedding) = 3)
);
INSERT INTO docs_fv_dimcheck (embedding) VALUES ('[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]');
SELECT * FROM docs_fv_dimcheck;
-- This INSERT is expected to fail with a CONSTRAINT violation,
-- that's the demo, not a bug in this script:
--   INSERT INTO docs_fv_dimcheck (embedding)
--     VALUES ('[0.1, 0.2]');  -- deliberately wrong dimension
-- On MySQL 9.7 Community, the native path enforces the SAME guarantee
-- at the column-type level instead (VECTOR(3), confirmed live, see
-- test_vector_type.py Scenario 3), no CHECK constraint needed there.

-- === Section 4: fractal_search_trajectory over the embedding column ===
-- fractal_search_trajectory is a PROCEDURE here (trailing OUT p_result
-- JSON), and its result shape is [{"doc_id":...,"dist":...}, ...], the
-- same doc_id/dist convention every search primitive in this extension
-- uses (sql/install_udf.sql).
-- baseline = row 1's embedding, current = row 2's: two DIFFERENT
-- points, so dist actually varies by row below (passing the same
-- LIMIT-1 subquery for both arguments would make every row's dist
-- identical, which this demo deliberately avoids).
CALL fractal_search_trajectory(
    'docs_fv', 'embedding',
    (SELECT embedding FROM docs_fv ORDER BY id LIMIT 1),
    (SELECT embedding FROM docs_fv ORDER BY id LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    2, @r);
SELECT * FROM JSON_TABLE(
    @r,
    '$[*]' COLUMNS (
        doc_id INT    PATH '$.doc_id',
        dist   DOUBLE PATH '$.dist'
    )
) AS jt;

-- === Section 5: fractal_vector operators and functions ===
-- Exercise the public vector-math surface: MySQL UDFs can't define
-- new operators, so every one below is a plain function call instead
-- of <->/<=>/<#>/+/-/scalar *. Names match sql/install_udf.sql.

-- The float8[]<->fractal_vector cast pair (fractal_vector_from_float8_array
-- / fractal_vector_to_float8_array) collapses to a no-op on the
-- portable path, since both sides are already the same JSON
-- representation. pg_typeof has no MySQL equivalent (no
-- UDF-return-type introspection function), so it's simply dropped.

-- === Section 6: storage comparison (portable path) ===
-- Both columns below are JSON text on the portable path, so
-- OCTET_LENGTH() shows near-identical sizes for equivalent data: no
-- compactness win here. That win does exist on MySQL 9.7 Community's
-- native VECTOR(n) (a real packed binary format:
-- VECTOR_TO_STRING(embedding) round-trips through the same
-- bracket-comma text this section compares, but the COLUMN itself
-- stores packed float4s, not JSON text). This comparison isn't
-- meaningful on the portable JSON path every supported major (8.4 LTS
-- included) is on, so it's kept as a same-size sanity check, not a
-- real "which is smaller" measurement.

-- === Section 7: L_p distance and quantization ===
-- Known 3-dim inputs, so the outputs are readable at a glance.

-- Generalized L_p distance, an explicit function rather than a default:
-- p=2 is the plain Euclidean distance (0.1414 for these two vectors).
-- p=0.5 is shown for contrast but is NOT a proper metric -- fractional
-- L_p breaks the triangle inequality and hurts recall on trained/
-- cosine-calibrated embeddings, so pass it deliberately, never as a
-- silent substitute for the search primitives' own cosine metric.
