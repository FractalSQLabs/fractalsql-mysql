-- demo/benchmark-api-reference.sql
--
-- Real, structural details worth knowing before reading this file:
--   - fractal_search_debug is not a separate function here: its
--     capability (a "trace" object with the converged best point/fit)
--     is a "debug":true flag on fractal_search's own params instead
--     (see docs/api-discovery.md), demonstrated in Section 1 below.
--   - fractal_store_morphology and fractal_mine_topology_negatives
--     (Section 8, "Named feature store") are stored PROCEDUREs here
--     (CALL + OUT param), composing the existing fractal_vector_l2_squared
--     UDF over a fixed internal table; see docs/api-analytics.md.
--   - fractal_search_telemetry/_hybrid_clinical_search/
--     _search_trajectory/_cross_modal_search are PROCEDUREs with a
--     trailing OUT p_result JSON here (sql/install_udf.sql), not
--     scalar functions, so every "SELECT fractal_x(...)" below becomes
--     CALL fractal_x(..., @r) then a JSON_TABLE over @r. Their result
--     objects use the key "dist".
--
-- A coverage pass over every callable function in sql/install_udf.sql
-- (roughly 46 functions: 9 core, a 4-function vectorizer group, 31
-- v2.x additions including the 10 v2.0.25 analytics/vector primitives
-- (Section 10), and the 2-procedure Named Feature Store), grouped by
-- area. Distinct from demo/benchmark.sql (a
-- narrower Sniper/Scout/vectorizer head-to-head), this one's job is
-- coverage, not comparison.
--
-- Fixtures are deliberately small and reused across sections. Reasoning-
-- dependent calls are wrapped the same way demo-business-intelligence.sql's
-- bi_safe_t2s() guards fractal_text_to_sql, so a missing/misconfigured
-- reasoning endpoint degrades that one row instead of aborting the rest.
--
-- Run: mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/benchmark-api-reference.sql
--
-- Safe to re-run: bmk_* tables are dropped and recreated each time.
--
-- NOTE: MySQL has no session-wide random seed equivalent to setseed().
-- RAND(seed) reseeds per-call, not per-session, so results here are not
-- bit-reproducible run to run. Not fixed here (would require plumbing a
-- seed through every RAND() call below); flagged as a known limitation,
-- not a silent omission.

-- bmk_safe_call: takes the risky call as a dynamic-SQL TEXT expression
-- and EXECUTEs it inside its own procedure body (PREPARE/EXECUTE INTO a
-- session variable), the same reasoning as bi_safe_t2s(): an ordinary
-- `bmk_safe_call(label, fractal_reason(...))` call would evaluate
-- fractal_reason() in the OUTER query before the handler is in scope.
