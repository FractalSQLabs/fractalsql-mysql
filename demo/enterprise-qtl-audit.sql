-- Enterprise Tier: Quantized Ternary Ledger (QTL) + CISO Audit, end to end.
--
-- The QTL ledger and CISO audit surface are enterprise-tier features,
-- runtime-gated behind the enterprise core shared library. The
-- community extension carries all the SQL signatures, but they are
-- DORMANT until the FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LIB PROCESS ENVIRONMENT
-- VARIABLE (set before mysqld starts, dlopen'd lazily, see
-- src/fractalsql_enterprise.c; not a sysvar/SET GLOBAL, since every
-- FractalSQL config knob on MySQL is a process environment variable
-- under the FRACTALSQL_ prefix) points at a present enterprise core
-- library (libfractalsql-enterprise-sovereign-c.so / .dylib / .dll).
--
-- When the enterprise lib isn't loaded, these functions do NOT raise a
-- catchable SIGNAL/exception, they return a silent NULL (`*error = 1`
-- inside the UDF makes the SQL result NULL for that row; it does not
-- abort the statement or propagate as a DECLARE ... HANDLER-catchable
-- condition, see src/fractalsql_enterprise.c's ENT_LEDGER_VOID_UDF/
-- ENT_LEDGER_COUNT_UDF macros). A HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '45000' guard
-- would simply never fire here, so this demo uses an explicit IS NULL
-- check on the first call instead.
--
-- This demo runs cleanly in BOTH states and tells you which one it found:
--   * Enterprise ACTIVE:  the ledger functions run for real.
--   * Enterprise DORMANT: the first ledger call returns NULL and the
--     demo prints a single message explaining the surface is
--     enterprise-only and how to activate it.
--
-- Both paths exit successfully so this script is safe to drop into a
-- CI / demo run on a community-only image.
--
-- Activate in the Docker demo container:
--   docker compose cp libfractalsql-enterprise-sovereign-c.so \
--       mysql:/tmp/libfractalsql-enterprise-sovereign-c.so
--   Then set FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LIB=/tmp/libfractalsql-enterprise-sovereign-c.so
--   in mysqld's environment (e.g. via docker-compose.yml's
--   `environment:` block for the mysql service) and restart the
--   container. There is no live-reload path, this is read once,
--   lazily, per process.
--
-- Safe to re-run: the in-memory ledger context is per-session (a fresh
-- client connection starts empty), but the PERSISTED ledger (see below)
-- is process-global and accumulates across runs: flush appends a new
-- chained entry each time, it never overwrites.
--
-- STORAGE: once FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LIB points at a real library, the
-- session ctx has a real file-backed storage VFS wired in
-- (unconditionally, on every deployment, see fractalsql_session.c).
-- flush/load genuinely persist and rehydrate the Truth/Shadow ledgers,
-- including across a mysqld restart. MySQL C UDFs have no way to
-- run SQL against the calling session, so the ledger
-- persists to a local file instead (FRACTALSQL_ENTERPRISE_LEDGER_PATH,
-- default fractalsql_ledger.dat relative to mysqld's cwd), with the
-- same append-only hash-chain and optional HMAC tamper-evidence
-- guarantees a SQL-table-backed ledger would carry, just not
-- SQL-queryable the same way directly (MySQL has no CONNECT storage
-- engine for an in-server mirror table; the CSV mirror is an external
-- read surface for audit tooling -- see docs/enterprise.md). This demo
-- reports whatever actually happens rather than assuming every step
-- below succeeds.

-- === 1. Seed real engagement events into the in-memory Truth/Shadow ledgers ===
-- fractal_feedback_report() is a COMMUNITY primitive, no enterprise
-- tier needed for this step. session_id (CONNECTION_ID()) is required
-- first, since mysqld is one shared process for every connection and
-- the ctx registry needs an explicit key. The in-memory ledger this
-- seeds is the SAME session's, so run this and Section 2 in one
-- connection.
