-- A cardinality-constrained portfolio problem (25 synthetic assets, a
-- 4-factor covariance model, optimize down to an 8-asset book) plus a
-- price series with a deliberate volatility regime change for DFA-based
-- regime detection -- a real, established DFA application (detecting
-- when a market series stops behaving like its own recent history) --
-- and fractal_change_point_detect (Section 3b) to localize exactly
-- where that regime change happened, rather than only characterizing
-- that the series' overall scaling behavior shifted. Not attributed to
-- a single originating paper -- a two-window mean/variance comparison
-- in the general change-point-detection family, not a port of a
-- specific published algorithm (e.g. not CUSUM/Page-Hinkley); see
-- THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md.
--
-- Structural notes (see sql/install_agents.sql's own header for the
-- full account):
--   - every fractal_agent_* engine is a PROCEDURE with a trailing
--     OUT p_result JSON param, not a RETURNS TABLE function, invoked as
--     `CALL fractal_agent_x(...args, @r); SELECT JSON_VALUE(@r,'$.field');`
--   - fractal_search_trajectory returns REAL vqf_allocation_snapshots.id
--     values as doc_id, so no remap is needed anywhere in this file.
--   - fractal_agent_rebalance_sibling's trailing args are (seed BIGINT,
--     context TEXT), see sql/install_agents.sql's own Engine K comment.
--   - fractal_optimize_portfolio takes mu/cov as JSON-array-string
--     arguments (cov: a flat, row-major n*n covariance array) plus a
--     JSON params object bundling seed/use_obl/diffusion_mode, rather
--     than trailing DEFAULT scalar arguments (MySQL's CREATE
--     FUNCTION has no DEFAULT-argument syntax).
--
-- Prerequisites:
--   1. SOURCE sql/install_udf.sql;      (the base UDF set)
--   2. SOURCE sql/install_agents.sql;   (fractal_agent_regime_triage,
--      fractal_agent_rebalance_sibling -- sections 0-2 need nothing else)
--   3. Reasoning configured (see docs/reasoning-setup.md) -- Sections 3 and 4's
--      presets call fractal_reason internally.
--
-- Run:
--   mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/demo-vertical-quant-finance.sql
--
-- Safe to re-run: vqf_* tables are dropped and recreated each time.
--
-- NOTE ON \timing / \echo / setseed: the mysql CLI has no direct
-- equivalent of psql's \timing (use `SET profiling = 1; ... SHOW
-- PROFILES;` for per-statement timing) or setseed() (RAND() here is
-- unseeded, so exact values differ run to run -- the demo's narrative
-- points, like the t=150 volatility regime change, are still
-- deterministic). Section markers below are plain comments, not
-- executed statements.

-- directly rather than inferring it from a windowed exponent
-- comparison. Original work (not a port of a specific published

-- applied directly to a random walk's LEVEL is a mismatch, since a
-- random walk's local mean wanders by construction, producing several
-- spurious extra "boundaries" alongside the real one. The steps
-- themselves have a genuine variance shift at t=150 (amplitude 0.02
-- before, 0.14 after) and nothing else changes, which is what this
