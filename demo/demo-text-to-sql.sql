-- demo/demo-text-to-sql.sql
--
-- Runnable walkthrough of the REAL fractal_text_to_sql() feature,
-- against a richer schema with real foreign keys, distinct from
-- demo/text-to-sql-spike-*.sql, which are throwaway hand-rolled
-- validation spikes (single-table, no FKs, driving
-- fractal_t2s_generate()/fractal_t2s_review() directly).
-- See docs/text-to-sql-setup.md for the full pipeline explanation, the
-- config reference, and the security model.
--
-- Prerequisites: UDFs registered (SOURCE sql/install_udf.sql;),
-- reasoning configured as process environment variables in mysqld's
-- own environment BEFORE it starts (mysqld has no live-reloadable
-- config mechanism a dlopen'd UDF library can hook into, so this can't
-- be a SET GLOBAL; see docs/reasoning-setup.md and build_test.sh's mdb_setup
-- for the export pattern). Confirm with:
--   SELECT fractal_reason(CONNECTION_ID(), 'reply with a short confirmation that this connection works');
-- before running this script.
--
-- fractal_schema_context() and fractal_text_to_sql() are both
-- PROCEDUREs here (trailing OUT params), not scalar functions: every
-- call below uses CALL ...(..., @out_var) then reads @out_var back,
-- not SELECT fractal_text_to_sql(...) directly.
--
-- Safe to re-run: the schema is dropped and recreated at the top.

-- === Section 1: schema context (what GENERATE actually sees) ===
CALL fractal_schema_context('["customers", "orders", "order_items"]', @ctx);
SELECT @ctx AS schema_context;

-- === Section 2: a simple single-table question ===
CALL fractal_text_to_sql(
    'How many customers have status active?',
    '["customers"]', @sql2, @err2);
SELECT @sql2 AS generated_sql, @err2 AS out_error;

-- === Section 3: a question requiring a join across the FK chain ===
CALL fractal_text_to_sql(
    'List the names of customers who have at least one paid order, with how many paid orders each has.',
    '["customers", "orders"]', @sql3, @err3);
SELECT @sql3 AS generated_sql, @err3 AS out_error;

-- === Section 4: a question requiring all three tables ===
CALL fractal_text_to_sql(
    'For each customer, what is the total value in cents of their paid orders (quantity times unit price, summed across all line items)?',
    '["customers", "orders", "order_items"]', @sql4, @err4);
SELECT @sql4 AS generated_sql, @err4 AS out_error;

-- === Section 5: run the generated SQL yourself ===
-- fractal_text_to_sql() never executes what it generates, that is
-- always a separate, explicit step. A user variable captured from the
-- OUT param straight into PREPARE/EXECUTE is arguably closer to what
-- production callers should do anyway (see docs/text-to-sql-setup.md's
-- execution-role grant guidance).
CALL fractal_text_to_sql(
    'What is the average number of line items per order?',
    '["orders", "order_items"]', @generated_sql, @err5);
-- "generated" is a reserved word in MySQL 8.0+ (ERROR 1064 as a bare
-- alias) -- the alias is quoted instead.
SELECT @generated_sql AS `generated`, @err5 AS out_error;

PREPARE t2s_stmt FROM @generated_sql;
EXECUTE t2s_stmt;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE t2s_stmt;

-- Next: docs/text-to-sql-setup.md for the config reference, the
-- execution-role grant pattern (do not run generated SQL as root in
-- production), and how to validate against your own local models with
-- tests/test_text_to_sql_shadow.py.

-- Clean up: DROP TABLE order_items, orders, customers;
