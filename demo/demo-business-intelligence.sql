-- demo/demo-business-intelligence.sql
--
-- A business-intelligence walkthrough, not just a text-to-sql
-- walkthrough: ask a plain-English business question, generate SQL,
-- EXECUTE it, and feed the real result back into fractal_reason() for
-- a narrative answer. Also covers Sniper Search (target customer
-- archetype) and Scout Discovery (find + name real customer segments).
--
-- Prerequisites: UDFs registered, reasoning configured, see
-- docs/reasoning-setup.md and confirm with:
--   SELECT fractal_reason(CONNECTION_ID(), 'reply with a short confirmation that this connection works');
--
-- Safe to re-run: the schema is dropped and recreated at the top.
--
-- Two structural notes worth knowing before reading this file:
--   1. fractal_text_to_sql() is a PROCEDURE here (question, table_names_
--      json, OUT out_sql, OUT out_error), not a scalar function.
--      MySQL stored FUNCTIONs can't CALL a procedure at all, so
--      wrapping it in a function with a HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION isn't
--      just extra ceremony, it's structurally impossible to write as a
--      function in the first place.
--   2. That kind of wrapper turns out to be unnecessary anyway:
--      fractal_text_to_sql() never SIGNALs on failure. It returns
--      cleanly with out_sql=NULL and out_error
--      set to a message (see sql/install_udf.sql's own header comment
--      on this procedure). Sections 2 and 3 below just CALL it
--      directly and branch on `out_error IS NOT NULL`, no exception
--      handler needed.
-- The mysql CLI still has no client-side \if/\gset the way psql does.
-- Sections 2 and 3 (which need "execute the generated SQL only if
-- generation succeeded") stay wrapped in stored PROCEDUREs with a
-- server-side IF for that reason, same as the original draft's
-- rationale, just without the now-removed function wrapper.

-- === 0. Sanity check: extension loaded? ===
