--
-- Industry vertical: Autonomous Fleet Management & Last-Mile Delivery.
--
-- A 40-vehicle delivery fleet with route-embedding vectors, one vehicle
-- running a deliberately-detouring route. Diverse depot-coverage
-- clustering, a cohort-restricted search (today's route-3 vehicles
-- only), current-vs-baseline detour detection, and GPS-trace
-- complexity via box-counting.
--
-- Structural details, confirmed against sql/install_udf.sql and
-- sql/install_agents.sql (see demo-agents.sql's own header for the
-- fuller account, not re-derived here):
--   - fractal_agent_recommend_diverse / fractal_agent_detour_classify
--     are PROCEDUREs with a trailing OUT p_result JSON param here, not
--     RETURNS TABLE functions, so every "SELECT ... FROM
--     fractal_agent_x(...)" below becomes
--     `CALL fractal_agent_x(...args, @r); SELECT JSON_VALUE(@r, ...)`.
--   - fractal_search_telemetry/_trajectory are PROCEDUREs too, and
--     already resolve + return each scanned table's own REAL
--     PRIMARY KEY value as "doc_id" (see sql/install_udf.sql's
--     _fractalsql_scan_corpus). There is no position-remapping step
--     anywhere in this file, and no doc_id = id - 1 shortcut either:
--     vehicle 5's UPDATE relocating its row, or a cohort filter's scan
--     order diverging from id order, has no effect on doc_id, since
--     doc_id is always the row's own primary key.
--   - fractal_search_explore(corpus, query, params) takes the corpus inline
--     as a JSON array rather than as a table/column reference (see
--     demo-business-intelligence.sql Section 6).
--   - There is no fixed-width vector column type here with a
--     write-time hard error on a dimension mismatch: this extension's
--     portable-path convention for these exact agents (see
--     demo-agents.sql's agents_demo_vehicles fixture) is a plain JSON
--     column populated via JSON_ARRAY()/JSON_EXTRACT() instead. Native
--     VECTOR(n) is 9.7/26.7 Community-only (see sql/install_udf.sql's own
--     header on the portable vs. native path) and not used for this
--     fixture.
--
-- Prerequisites:
--   1. fractalsql-mysql installed and `SOURCE sql/install_udf.sql;`
--      and `SOURCE sql/install_agents.sql;` already run against the
--      target database (sections 0-4 need nothing else).
--   2. Section 6 narrates that its reasoning step is folded into the
--      Section 5 fractal_agent_detour_classify preset rationale, which
--      calls fractal_reason() internally -- see docs/reasoning-setup.md for
--      reasoning setup.
--
-- Run:
--   mysql -u root -p <your_database> < demo/demo-vertical-fleet-logistics.sql
--
-- Safe to re-run: vfl_* tables are dropped and recreated each time.
--
-- NOTE ON \timing / \echo: the mysql CLI has no direct equivalent of
-- psql's \timing; use `SET profiling = 1; ... SHOW PROFILES;` if you
-- want per-statement timing. Section markers below are plain comments,
-- not executed statements (unlike psql's \echo, which prints even when
-- run non-interactively).
--
-- NOTE: MySQL has no session-wide random seed equivalent to
-- setseed(). RAND(seed) reseeds per-call, not per-session, so results
-- here are not bit-reproducible run to run. Flagged as a known
-- limitation, not a silent omission.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------
-- === 2. fractal_search_explore: diverse route/zone clustering ===
-- --- Preset: fractal_agent_recommend_diverse (raw explore form preserved below) ---

-- route/zone-cluster embeddings across the fleet. fractal_search_explore

-- Productized preset: the shipped engine returns real vehicle ids + scores
-- (1 - cosine_distance) with session-global repulsion enabled, then we
-- restore the session so the section-3 cohort search below sees the same
-- diversify-off state as before (the engine leaves diversify on -- the
-- caller owns that policy). The blueprint's zero query is query-agnostic
-- (explore samples the space); recommend_diverse is query-anchored, so
-- anchor on the first vehicle's own current_pos vector. No id_col
-- argument and no ctid/row_number id-resolution step -- this engine
-- returns the table's own real PRIMARY KEY directly (see this file's
-- header).

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Cohort-restricted search: "today's route-3 vehicles only" --
-- fractal_search_telemetry's table_name argument is a plain text table
-- name, so a cohort filter composes by searching a filtered table
-- instead (the same cohort-then-search shape
-- fractal_hybrid_clinical_search uses internally for its doc_ids
-- allowlist, without needing that clinically-named function here).
--
-- vfl_route3_cohort is created as an explicit column list with its own
-- PRIMARY KEY (id), not `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... AS SELECT *`:
-- fractal_search_telemetry (sql/install_udf.sql's
-- _fractalsql_scan_corpus) requires the table it scans to carry
-- exactly one single-column PRIMARY KEY, and a plain AS SELECT copy
-- drops that constraint even though it copies the data.
--
-- It's a PERMANENT table, not TEMPORARY, even though it's scratch
-- data dropped/recreated on every run (confirmed against a live
-- server): the information_schema catalog -- which _fractalsql_scan_
-- corpus uses for BOTH the PRIMARY KEY check above and its vector_col
-- type lookup -- has no visibility into TEMPORARY tables at all
-- (SHOW CREATE TABLE reports the PK correctly; information_schema.
-- key_column_usage/columns return zero rows regardless). A
-- TEMPORARY table here fails scan_corpus's PK check even with an
-- explicit single-column PRIMARY KEY declared.
--
-- fractal_search_telemetry always resolves and returns the scanned
-- table's own real PRIMARY KEY value as doc_id, so a plain join on
-- id = doc_id is correct regardless of which rows are in the cohort
-- or what order they were inserted/updated in, even though vehicle 5
-- was UPDATEd (see this file's header, and
-- demo-vertical-cybersecurity-threat-detection.sql's Section 3/4 for
-- the same point).

-- 5 -- detour detection, "what changed" not "what's closest".
--
-- Unlike section 3, this scans the FULL vfl_vehicles table -- which
-- includes vehicle 5's own updated row. That's not a problem here:
-- fractal_search_trajectory
-- already returns real vehicle ids as doc_id, so a plain join on

-- this file's header).

-- Blueprint (raw primitive): the current-vs-baseline DELTA search for
-- vehicle 5's detour. Generalized by the shipped
-- fractal_agent_detour_classify preset in Section 5, which folds this
-- trajectory search together with the GPS-trace box-counting complexity
-- and a reasoning step.
-- CALL fractal_search_trajectory(

-- detoured route (a 2D wandering path, 200 samples) -- a smooth planned
-- route would trace a near-straight path (dimension close to 1); a
-- detour with backtracking/wandering pushes it higher.

-- === 5. fractal_dimension_boxcount: vehicle 5's GPS trace complexity ===

-- Blueprint (raw primitive): the GPS trace's box-counting complexity.
-- Generalized below by the fractal_agent_detour_classify preset, which
-- folds this together with the Section 4 trajectory search and a
-- reasoning step. The Postgres CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(...) shape
-- has no MySQL equivalent either (UDFs can't return tables), so
-- pairing the two ordinates uses a UNION ALL instead (same idiom
-- demo-agents.sql already uses for this exact agent's own fixture).
