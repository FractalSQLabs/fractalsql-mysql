# build_test.sh: post-build validation gate runner for
# fractalsql-mysql. Mirrors what CI runs, so local == CI. Numbered
# gates with a shared PASS/FAIL/SKIP harness shape. Gates 03/04/10/12/13/
# 20-25 below cover the full UDF/procedure surface: Discovery, Text-to-
# SQL, the Vectorizer, Analytics, Diversify, the Vector tier, Cognition,
# Agency, and Enterprise activation gating. Gates 05/07/08/14-18 (the
# reasoning-VFS-ABI-level "evil plugin" gates and their embed/authz/
# soak/crash siblings) are ALSO ported now -- see the reasoning-tier
# bullet below for how. Deliberately still NOT ported: a superuser-only
# config gate (09) and a real (non-mock) enterprise-.so gate (this
# repo's own 26/27/28 cover related but different real-.so ground),
# each with its own documented reason, not a placeholder.
#
# Architecture differences that shape what each gate can claim (read
# before assuming a gate maps 1:1 from other database ecosystems):
#   * ONE fractalsql.so covers every supported MySQL major (8.4 LTS,
#     9.7 LTS, and 26.7): the UDF ABI
#     (UDF_INIT/UDF_ARGS/MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE, and no my_bool since 8.0)
#     has been stable across all of them. So
#     gate_01_build here compiles ONCE, with no per-major rebuild +
#     reinstall of the extension; --mysql <major> only selects which
#     mysqld binary the live-cluster gates start against.
#   * No CREATE EXTENSION. "Install" = point mysqld at a scratch
#     --plugin-dir containing fractalsql.so, then run
#     `mysql ... < sql/install_udf.sql` (CREATE FUNCTION ... SONAME).
#   * Reasoning-tier gates (03/04/13/20-24) dispatch through the REAL
#     fractalsql-reasoning-http.so plugin against a deterministic local
#     mock (scripts/ci/mock_llm.py, started in mysql_setup before
#     mysqld) rather than a fake in-process reasoning-VFS plugin
#     approach, exercising the actual dlopen/curl/HTTP path,
#     just with a canned server on the other end. Gates 05/07/14/15/18
#     instead swap FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN to a reasoning-VFS-ABI-
#     level test fixture (tests/evil_*.c, tests/retry_reasoning_plugin.c
#     -- pure C against the shared vendored fractalsql_sql.h, with no
#     server-specific API reference at all) via
#     mysql_swap_reasoning_plugin(), a restart-based swap (see that
#     function's own comment: FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN is a process
#     environment variable read once at mysqld startup, no live-reload
#     -- it is not a server system variable). A server-design wrinkle
#     these gates have to account for on MySQL exactly as on any other
#     single-process server: the evil plugins' call_count statics are
#     process-wide, and mysqld is one shared process for every
#     connection -- call_count keeps incrementing across every call for
#     the process's whole lifetime. So gates 05/07 restart before EACH
#     of their three call sites (GENERATE/bare fractal_reason/
#     fractal_t2s_review), not once for the whole gate; see
#     gate_05_evil_overread's own header comment for the full account. A
#     well-behaved fallback mock plugin was NOT needed here: MySQL's own
#     baseline (the real HTTP wrapper against scripts/ci/mock_llm.py)
#     already serves that role, restored via mysql_restore_reasoning_
#     plugin() at the end of every evil-plugin gate. Also NOT needed: a
#     hardcoded-vector embed mock specifically, since mock_llm.py's
#     embeddings route already returns the same canned [0.1,0.2,0.3]
#     vector such a fixture would hardcode.
#   * 06 still uses a standalone evil UDF (tests/evil_crash_udf.c) that
#     segfaults when called. This is a genuinely different, simpler
#     claim than the reasoning-plugin crash gates above (see gate 06's
#     own header comment), not a stand-in for them.
#   * 09 superuser-only config has NO MySQL equivalent to port, permanently:
#     not "blocked," genuinely not applicable. Cognition-tier config
#     lives in mysqld process environment variables
#     (FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN etc.), not sysvars, specifically
#     because installing this as a plugin-bound sysvar would tie the
#     one-.so-per-(arch,libc) distribution model to a single server
#     plugin-interface version (see fractalsql_cognition.c's file header
#     for the full account); there is no sysvar surface for a
#     superuser-only restriction to exist on.
#   * 26 (a real, non-mock enterprise .so) is not ported for the same
#     reason this repo's Enterprise tier stops short of the ledger's
#     actual storage layer: see src/fractalsql_enterprise.c's file
#     header. 25 below covers what IS real and testable: the
#     dlopen/dlsym activation-gating wiring itself, which would need a
#     purpose-built stub .so to exercise against a loaded library
#     (scripts/ci has no fixture for it yet, a reasonable follow-up).
#   * MySQL's mysqld has NO built-in auto-restart-after-crash.
#     A multi-process server with an outer supervising daemon can
#     tear down and reinit shared memory after any child crash and
#     come back up on its own: that is a real architectural guarantee
#     such a platform can just observe. mysqld has no equivalent: a
#     UDF call segfaulting takes down the WHOLE (single, mostly-threaded)
#     mysqld process, and nothing built into mysqld brings it back. The
#     platform-level guarantee actually worth testing is narrower:
#     InnoDB's own crash recovery (redo-log replay on next startup, so
#     committed data survives); getting the PROCESS itself to come
#     back requires an outer supervisor. This script uses `mysqld_safe`
#     (MySQL's own packaged supervisor, shipped by mysql-server on
#     Linux and by the official Docker images) when available and
#     falls back to a small manual respawn loop if it is not found.
#     Gate 06 verifies BOTH halves separately: (a) the supervisor
#     actually respawns mysqld, (b) InnoDB crash recovery leaves prior
#     committed data intact. Do not overstate what this gate proves: it
#     is a different, weaker platform guarantee, tested honestly rather
#     than assumed equivalent.

# all honor response_len_out and never treat `summary` as a NUL-
# terminated C string, at all three call sites that dispatch through

#
# IMPORTANT MySQL-specific design note: the evil plugin's call_count
# is a process-wide static, but mysqld is ONE
# shared process for every connection (a per-connection process model
# would dlopen the plugin fresh for each new connection, resetting
# call_count to 0) -- call_count keeps incrementing
# across every UDF call in the process's lifetime, connection or not.
# So this gate restarts mysqld (via mysql_swap_reasoning_plugin) before
# EACH of the three call sites, not once for the whole gate: only that
# guarantees call_count=0 (matching FSQL_EVIL_TRIGGER_CALL's default,
# trigger=1) at every site actually under test, the guarantee a
# per-connection process model gets for free. Slower (3 restarts
# instead of 1) but the only way this is correct here.

# FRACTALSQL_REASONING_PLUGIN, and this gate needs the REAL HTTP
# plugin against scripts/ci/mock_llm.py to stay active -- mock_llm.py
