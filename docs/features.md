# FractalSQL Feature Specification

FractalSQL is a tiered capability framework that runs discovery, reasoning,
and agentic workflows inside the MySQL backend: no external RAG
middleware shuffling data between the database and the LLM. It provides a
progression from basic vector discovery to autonomous agentic reasoning.

---

## 🏗️ Capability Tiering Model

FractalSQL ships in two editions, each unlocking more of the four
capability tiers described below (Discovery → Cognition → Agency →
Analytics). The editions are a *build/licensing* axis; the capability tiers
are a *functional* axis. A single install belongs to one edition and
exposes whichever capability tiers that edition includes.

| Tier | Focus | Key Capabilities | Build / Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Community** | Discovery, Cognition, Agency | SFS Core, Sniper Search, Scout Discovery, In-DB Reasoning, Embeddings, 15 of the 16 Agents | Base UDF set (`fractalsql.so`), everything most installs need |
| **Enterprise** | Governance | Activation gating plus a real, tamper-evident ledger storage layer. See [Enterprise Tier](enterprise.md) for the full scope |

---

## 🔍 Tier 1: Discovery

The foundation of FractalSQL is the **Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS)**
engine, which treats vector search as a continuous optimization problem
rather than an index lookup like standard HNSW.

### Sniper Search (`fractal_search`)
Pure SFS convergence to the single best point minimizing cosine distance to
a query. Also the corpus top-k search: pass a real inline corpus for top-k,
or an empty one (`''`) to run pure convergence with no corpus at all. It is
a "precision" tool for finding the absolute global minimum.

### Scout Discovery (`fractal_search_explore`)
An SFS population search blended with **Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)**
re-ranking, so the results cover the data's distinct basins of attraction
instead of the "mode collapse" common in top-K search. Scout Mode takes its
corpus as one inline argument. MySQL's C UDF ABI can't run SQL against
the calling session and has no
table-returning UDFs at all, so there is no server-side table scan for it.

### Table-Backed Telemetry (`fractal_search_telemetry`)
A stored procedure that returns the $K$ nearest real table rows to a query
(`CALL fractal_search_telemetry(table, col, query, k, @result)`). This is
the ground-truth layer used by every table-backed agent.

---

## 🧠 Tier 2: Cognition

The Cognition tier adds a reasoning bridge to the SFS core, allowing it to
call LLMs and embedding models via a pluggable C provider interface. This
enables reasoning to happen *beside* the data.

### In-Database Reasoning (`fractal_reason`)
Dispatches a query and a context payload to a configured LLM provider.
`fractal_reason(session_id, query [, context])`. `session_id`
(`CONNECTION_ID()`) is required and first, a requirement specific to this
shared-process architecture (one shared multithreaded server process, not
one process per connection).
Because it runs inside the backend, you can feed it the results of a Scout
search or a SQL query in one statement.

**Provider-agnostic**: the same `fractal_reason()` call works against
**AWS Bedrock (SigV4)**, **Azure OpenAI**, **GCP Vertex AI**, or **local
Ollama**. Switch providers by restarting `mysqld` with different env
vars (no live-reconfigure, see [Reasoning Setup](reasoning-setup.md) for
why). Local providers keep data on your own infrastructure; cloud
providers send it to that provider under your own account and agreement
(BAA-covered where your compliance posture requires it).

### Semantic Embeddings (`fractal_embed`)
Generates vectors from text using a purpose-trained embedding model,
`fractal_embed(session_id, input)`. Returns a `fractal_vector`
JSON-array-string, the portable TEXT/JSON tier that is the baseline on
all supported majors (MySQL 8.4 LTS has no native vector type at all;
9.7's native `VECTOR(n)` is an optional fast path). This removes the need for an
external embedding pipeline for many RAG use cases.

### Safe Text-to-SQL (`fractal_text_to_sql`)
Generates SQL from natural language, as a `CALL`-based stored procedure here
(`CALL fractal_text_to_sql(question, table_names_json, @sql, @err)`) rather
than a function, since the pipeline composes several C primitives via
SQL/PSM instead of running as a single UDF call. Four-stage safety
pipeline:
1. **GENERATE**: LLM produces a candidate, fenced-block extraction handled
   automatically.
2. **ALLOWLIST**: a hand-written lexical scanner rejects multi-statement,
   disallowed statement types, and `INTO OUTFILE`/`DUMPFILE`.
3. **REVIEW** (optional): a second LLM call critiques the candidate.
4. **EXPLAIN-equivalent**: `PREPARE`s (never executes) the candidate to
   catch column/type mismatches before returning the SQL.

---

## 🤖 Tier 3: Agency

The Agency tier composes the Discovery and Cognition primitives into
autonomous routines: 16 installable agent stored procedures, each a
productized recipe for a recurring pattern, built on 6 reusable Universal
Agent procedures you can also call directly. See
[`docs/api-agency.md`](api-agency.md) for the full argument reference,
examples, and notes.

### Universal Agents

The six building blocks the agents above compose. Every one is a plain
stored PROCEDURE with a trailing `OUT` parameter (a MySQL C UDF can't run
SQL against the calling session), reaching its target table the same way
the table-backed Discovery primitives do. Call them directly to build your
own recipe.

| Procedure | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `fractal_search_agent` | Embed a query, Scout-search a table, and reason over the matched rows. |
| `fractal_rag_agent` | Focused single-turn RAG: embed, Scout-search, and reason over the result. |
| `fractal_sql_agent` | Self-correcting NL-to-SQL, retrying on validation failure, with an optional auto-execute step. |
| `fractal_agent_plan_explore` | Scout-search-driven exploration of multiple non-overlapping strategy branches. |
| `fractal_agent_trajectory_predict` | Forecasts future state from a delta against a table's historical rows. |
| `fractal_agent_detect_loop` | Flags infinite/repetitive agent loops via SimHash state fingerprints and Brent's cycle detector, with a DFA drift check. |

### Safe Agency & Guardrails

To prevent "hallucination-driven" database corruption, the Agency tier
relies on two primary guardrails:

1. **The `PREPARE`-only barrier**: `fractal_text_to_sql`/`fractal_sql_agent`
   `PREPARE` (never `EXECUTE`) the generated SQL as part of validation. A
   malformed candidate is caught mechanically and fed back to the LLM for a
   retry, with nothing ever run against your session's transaction state
   during validation itself.
2. **The Deterministic Allowlist**: `FRACTALSQL_TEXT_TO_SQL_ALLOWED_STATEMENTS`
   (a process env var, not a per-role setting) strictly limits the types of
   SQL the pipeline can generate (e.g., preventing `DROP TABLE` even if the
   LLM suggests it).

---

## 📐 Tier 4: Analytics

The final tier provides mathematical primitives for analyzing the "shape"
of data and state, turning raw vectors into actionable structural insights.

### Fractal Dimension Analysis
- **DFA (`fractal_dimension_dfa`)**: Analyzes the scaling exponent of a
  time series to distinguish between noise, random walks, and structured
  signals.
- **Box-Counting (`fractal_dimension_boxcount`)**: Measures the
  Minkowski-Bouligand dimension of a point cloud to evaluate spatial
  complexity.
- **Drift (`fractal_dimension_drift`)**: Detects regime changes by
  comparing the DFA exponent of a recent window against a baseline.

### Time-Series and Topology
- **Change-Point Localization (`fractal_change_point_detect`)**: Localizes
  where a series' mean or variance shifted, complementing DFA's overall
  characterization.
- **Periodogram (`fractal_periodogram`)**: Exact power spectrum (direct DFT)
  for cadence detection such as network beaconing or retry loops.
- **Persistence (`fractal_tda_persistence_diagram`)**: Exact 0-dimensional
  persistence over a point cloud's Vietoris-Rips filtration, plus the graph
  cycle rank as an informational Betti-number estimate.
- **SimHash (`fractal_state_fingerprint`)**: Folds a state vector into a
  Hamming-comparable fingerprint where nearly-identical states collide.
- **Cycle Detection (`fractal_cycle_detect`)**: Streaming Brent's algorithm
  over a fingerprint stream, one output per cycle closure.

### Domain-Specific Geometry
FractalSQL provides optimized routines for pre-extracted biological and
technical geometry: vascular networks (tortuosity, branch-density),
cortical folding (Gyrification Index), nerve plexus (density, dimension),
and morphological complexity (box-counting + lacunarity for segmented
masks).

### Portfolio Optimization
`fractal_optimize_portfolio` uses the SFS engine to solve
cardinality-constrained Sharpe-ratio maximization: the best $K$ assets in a
large universe without the exponential cost of a brute-force search.
`fractal_optimize_subset` generalizes the same search to value-weighted
allocation over any scored item list with per-item bounds.

### Vector Math
- **$L_p$ Distance (`fractal_vector_lp_distance`)**: Generalized distance
  for any $p > 0$ (for $0 < p < 1$ this is not a proper metric; use it
  explicitly, never as a silent default).
- **Quantization (`fractal_vector_quantize_int8` / `_binary`)**: 4x/32x
  per-vector compression with Hamming pre-filtering
  (`fractal_vector_hamming_distance`) ahead of a full-precision re-rank.

## 📈 Benchmarks & Scaling

### Native `VECTOR(n)` exact scan vs. Scout Discovery

At 5000 vectors across 50 Gaussian clusters, dim=128, a **comparatively
small** default, and deliberately so: Scout
Mode (`fractal_search_explore`) has no server-side scan at all, every call
re-sends the whole corpus as a client-supplied string; at large row counts
that string would be hundreds of megabytes per query. See
`bench/README.md` for the full methodology and reasoning. This is a
real architectural ceiling, not a smaller-is-easier choice. Measured
directly (treat the figures as representative, not freshly re-measured
every release). Community MySQL has no native vector distance function
of any name -- `DISTANCE()`/`COSINE_DISTANCE()`/`VECTOR_DISTANCE()` are
all HeatWave-only -- so the Community equivalent of that exact scan is
`fractal_vector_cosine_distance()` over the portable JSON-string column:

- **Native `VECTOR(n)` exact scan** (top-50) typically discovered
  **~1 cluster**, in single-digit milliseconds (measured: 4.6 ms avg).
- **Scout** (pop=50) typically discovered **~5-7 clusters**, roughly
  **40-45x slower** than the native exact scan at this scale (measured:
  197.5 ms avg, 43.3x slower, 4.7x more clusters discovered).

(Community MySQL has no ANN vector index on `VECTOR(n)` at all -- that's a
HeatWave-only feature -- so the native comparison is an exact scan, not an
indexed lookup, on both supported majors.)

That tradeoff is the whole point of Scout Mode, not a hidden cost: it's
$O(N \times d)$ (linear scan) by design, and it's the only way here to
guarantee your LLM receives a genuinely diverse set of perspectives rather
than a single collapsed cluster. It is not a drop-in replacement for the
native exact scan. Use it where diversity matters more than latency (curated
sub-corpora, not full-corpus top-k at scale).

### Storage: TEXT/JSON-string vs. native `VECTOR(n)`

There is no custom `fractal_vector` SQL type here
(MySQL has no `CREATE TYPE`/type-modifier mechanism at all). The real comparison
is this repo's portable TEXT/JSON-array-string convention (the baseline on
all supported majors) against MySQL 9.7 LTS's
own built-in `VECTOR(n)` column type (MySQL 8.4 LTS has no vector type at
all). Measured at 5000 rows,
dim=128: `VECTOR(n)` is **~2.4x smaller on disk** (fixed 4
bytes/dim, architecturally fixed, not data-dependent) and loads **~2x
faster** in bulk. It was **~50% slower**, in this measurement, for
`fractal_search_trajectory`-style table-backed search latency, since the
`VECTOR_TO_STRING()` conversion step this repo's search compositions need to read
a native column costs more than reading plain `TEXT` directly. Not a clean
sweep either way; measure on your own workload (see `bench/README.md`'s
`vector_type_head_to_head.py` section for the full numbers and caveats).
