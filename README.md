# FractalSQL: Sovereign Data Intelligence
### Sovereign, Agentic MySQL

**Vector Search. In-Database Reasoning. Production-Safe Agency. All beside your data.**

FractalSQL transforms MySQL from a passive data store into an active agentic
database. FractalSQL adds what traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
stops short of: reasoning over what it retrieves, and when you enable it
acting on the result, whether that's running a generated query or executing a
decision an agent computed, all inside the same database process.

By bringing reasoning and agency directly into the MySQL server, FractalSQL
enables **Sovereign Data Intelligence**: the ability to reason, plan, and act upon
your data with the deployment topology under your control. Run fully on-prem or in
your own containers with Ollama/vLLM for zero data egress, or point at your
organization's cloud AI accounts (Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Vertex), where your compliance 
posture requires it, for managed-model scale. You control the trade, not the product.

| Traditional RAG Stack | The Sovereign Way (FractalSQL) |
| --- | --- |
| **Mode Collapse**: top-K search returns near-duplicates, starving the LLM of diverse context. | **Scout Discovery**: MMR-style diverse semantic search that discovers the data's real structure. |
| **Fragmented Logic**: app pulls rows, calls LLM, handles retries, and glues answers in middleware. | **In-Database Reasoning**: reasoning and embedding happen inside the backend process itself. |
| **Passive Retrieval**: you ask a question, the DB returns rows, and you hope the LLM is correct. | **Autonomous Agency**: self-correcting SQL, loop detection, and trajectory forecasting. |

## From zero to your first agent

FractalSQL's docs follow a single linear path. Each step answers one question
and hands off to the next. You don't need to read everything; follow the path.

1. **What is this and why do I care?**: you are here. Sovereign Data Intelligence, in one page.
2. **How do I get the UDFs running in 5 minutes?** → [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) (`docker compose up -d`, or the native `.deb`/`.rpm`/`.msi`, then your first Scout search).
3. **How do I apply this to my industry?** → [Starter Kits](docs/starter-kits.md): a problem → agent map using the 16 shipped agents, plus all eleven industry-vertical demo *scripts*, verified end to end (see [demo/README.md](demo/README.md#industry-vertical-demos)).
4. **How does a specific agent work and what are its inputs?** → [Agent Reference](docs/api-agency.md): the sixteen installable agents, each with a real `CALL` example.
5. **How do I build a proprietary agent that isn't in the box?** → [Composition Guide](docs/composition-guide.md): the design patterns behind the shipped agents.

> New here? Step 2 is a one-command demo. Step 4 is the reference you'll keep
> coming back to.

## 🎯 Who are you?

Depending on your role, you'll want to start in different places:

- **AI Engineer**: You want to improve RAG quality and reasoning.
  → Start with **[docs/features.md](docs/features.md)** and **[docs/reasoning-setup.md](docs/reasoning-setup.md)**.
- **DBA / Security Architect**: You care about stability, safety, and grants.
  → See **[docs/text-to-sql-setup.md](docs/text-to-sql-setup.md)**'s safety-pipeline section, and note MySQL's **no Row-Level Security** gap called out there plainly: this repo doesn't paper over it.
- **Product Developer**: You want to build agentic features quickly.
  → Run the **[Docker Demo](docs/docker-demo.md)**, then pick a **[Starter Kit](docs/starter-kits.md)**.

## 🧩 What's in the box

Four tiers of SQL-callable primitives, composable into agents with plain
MySQL stored procedures.

- **Discovery**: diverse, mode-collapse-free retrieval: `fractal_search` (Sniper), `fractal_search_explore` (Scout), `fractal_search_telemetry` (table-backed top-K, and its siblings `fractal_hybrid_clinical_search`/`fractal_search_trajectory`/`fractal_cross_modal_search`).
- **Cognition**: in-database LLM integration: `fractal_reason` (Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Vertex, Ollama), `fractal_embed`, `fractal_text_to_sql`, plus an automatic **Vectorizer** pipeline (trigger-driven, MySQL 9.7/26.7 Community native `VECTOR(n)` aware; the portable JSON-string vector convention covers 8.4 LTS, which has no VECTOR type).
- **Agency**: self-correcting stored procedures: **sixteen installable agents** spanning anomaly triage, portfolio allocation, hybrid recall, route planning, deterioration triage, regime detection, and more. See the [Agent Reference](docs/api-agency.md).
- **Analytics**: fractal/dimension primitives: `fractal_dimension_dfa`, `fractal_dimension_boxcount`, `fractal_optimize_portfolio`, and more.

Every primitive is an ordinary SQL function or stored procedure, no
`CREATE EXTENSION`, no dependent-extension system, UDFs registered once via
`sql/install_udf.sql` and `sql/install_agents.sql`. When you're ready to build
your own agent, the [Composition Guide](docs/composition-guide.md) walks
through the patterns the shipped agents use.

A MySQL C UDF can't run SQL against the calling session, and MySQL has no
table-returning UDFs. Every primitive that would otherwise be a
table-scanning or set-returning C function is re-architected instead:
inline-corpus arguments for Discovery, `CALL`-with-`OUT`-JSON-param
stored procedures for anything that touches a table (schema
introspection, text-to-sql, the vectorizer, every agent). See any
`docs/api-*.md` page for the exact calling convention of a given
primitive.

## 🚀 Get it running

The fastest path is one command. See **[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)**
for the 5-minute Docker run and the native installers:

```bash
docker compose up -d   # then connect and run your first Scout search
```

```bash
# Or, on a real MySQL install (Linux/macOS):
git clone https://github.com/FractalSQLabs/fractalsql-mysql.git && cd fractalsql-mysql
./scripts/easy_install.sh   # detects your MySQL install, offers to install the package, walks you through reasoning setup
```

Native installers (MySQL 8.4 LTS / 9.7 LTS / 26.7): `.deb` /
`.rpm` for Linux amd64/arm64, an unsigned `.zip` for macOS (arm64/x86_64),
and a per-major `.msi` for Windows x64. See the compatibility table below.
`easy_install.sh` (Linux/macOS) and `scripts/windows/easy_install.ps1`
(Windows) wrap all of these behind one interactive wizard; no telemetry,
everything stays local.

## 🏛️ Enterprise Tier

Everything above is Community edition and fully functional on its own.
Discovery, Cognition, and Agency don't depend on anything in this section. For regulated
environments that need to **prove, not just
claim**, what an autonomous agent decided and why, an optional drop-in
library adds a tamper-evident, hash-chained decision ledger: no rebuild, no
extension reload, activated by a single environment variable. See
**[Enterprise Tier](docs/enterprise.md)** for the full mechanism, including
what the hash chain can and can't prove.
