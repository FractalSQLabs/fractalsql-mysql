REM
REM Builds fractalsql.dll on Windows with the MSVC toolchain using
REM static CRT (/MT) and whole-program optimization (/GL), matching
REM the Linux/macOS posture: zero runtime dependency on the Visual C++
REM Redistributable, and zero dependency on LuaJIT. It statically links
REM the vendored pure-C core archive instead, the same
REM community-sovereign-c archive the Linux/macOS builds link, see
REM CORE_VARIANT in Makefile/build.sh.
REM
REM One DLL per (MySQL major, arch) cell: the UDF ABI is stable
REM across 8.4 / 9.7 / 26.x, but we still build per-major on
REM Windows because the install target path differs per server
REM installation (C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server ^<VER^>\lib\plugin\).
REM
REM Prerequisites
REM   * Visual Studio Build Tools (cl.exe on PATH: invoke from a
REM     Developer Command Prompt, or `call vcvarsall.bat ^<arch^>` first).
REM   * A MySQL Windows binaries tree (mysql-^<VER^>-winx64.zip
REM     from downloads.mysql.com), unpacked so that:
REM         %MYSQL_DIR%\include\mysql.h
REM     exists (MySQL's winx64 zips carry mysql.h DIRECTLY under
REM     include\, with no include\mysql\ subdirectory in between). Only
REM     headers are needed, since UDFs don't link against a server
REM     import lib.
REM   * The vendored core archive at include\windows-x86_64\
REM     fractalsql-%CORE_VARIANT%.lib (this repo's own include/, the
REM     same source as the Linux/macOS archives; see Makefile's own
REM     CORE_VARIANT comment).
REM   * OpenSSL, static (x64-windows-static triplet, matching /MT below),
REM     for src\fractalsql_enterprise.c's ent_verify_signature() (Ed25519
REM     signature check on the enterprise .so before loading it).
REM     MySQL's official
REM     Windows binaries are statically linked against wolfSSL, not
REM     OpenSSL (confirmed directly: the winx64 zip ships no libcrypto.lib
REM     or openssl/ headers at all) -- there is nothing to reuse here, so
REM     this needs its own independent OpenSSL, brought in via vcpkg (the
REM     standard way to get MSVC-compatible headers and a static .lib --
REM     same tool fractalsql-reasoning-http's own Windows build already
REM     uses for libcurl, pre-installed on GitHub's
REM     windows-latest/windows-2022 runners at C:\vcpkg).
REM       vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows-static
REM     Defaults to C:\vcpkg below; override via VCPKG_ROOT if yours
REM     lives elsewhere.
REM     Statically linked, so this adds no new runtime DLL dependency.
REM
REM Environment overrides
REM   MYSQL_DIR     directory with MySQL binaries tree
REM                 (the "mysql-^<VER^>-winx64" root from the ZIP)
REM   MYSQL_MAJOR   MySQL major version being targeted (e.g. 8.4, 9.7, 26.7)
REM   OUT_DIR       output directory for fractalsql.dll
REM   CORE_VARIANT  vendored core archive selector (default community-sovereign-c)
REM   VCPKG_ROOT    vcpkg install root (default: C:\vcpkg)

REM Vendored core static lib. -import.lib is the DLL-linkage stub for
REM dynamic linking against fractalsql-community-*.dll. It is
REM deliberately NOT used here, since that would give fractalsql.dll a
REM runtime dependency on a second DLL, contradicting the
REM zero-extra-runtime-dependency posture the /MT static CRT is already
REM going for.

REM OpenSSL (static): src\fractalsql_enterprise.c needs openssl/evp.h
REM and links against libcrypto for Ed25519 signature verification. See
REM this file's own Prerequisites comment for how to get it via vcpkg.
REM Same VCPKG_ROOT convention as fractalsql-reasoning-http's own
REM scripts\build-windows.ps1: default to C:\vcpkg (pre-installed at
REM that exact path on GitHub's windows-latest/windows-2022 runners),
REM overridable via the environment.
REM ORDERING TRAP: VS's own vcvars64.bat/vsdevcmd.bat RESET VCPKG_ROOT
REM to the VS-bundled vcpkg (VC\vcpkg), whose installed/ tree typically
REM lacks the x64-windows-static triplet -- so set VCPKG_ROOT AFTER
REM calling vcvars, not before, or the value you exported is silently
REM overwritten before this script runs.

REM cl.exe flags:
REM   /MT     static CRT (no MSVC runtime DLL dependency)
REM   /GL     whole-program optimization (paired with /LTCG at link)
REM   /O2     optimize for speed
REM   /LD     build a DLL
REM   /DWIN32 /D_WINDOWS /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
REM
REM   /DFSQL_STATIC: switches fractalsql.h's FSQL_API macro from the
REM   default dllimport (consumer-of-a-DLL mode) to a plain extern,
REM   matching the vendored static .lib we link below (see
REM   include/fractalsql.h:82-91). Without this the compiler emits
REM   __imp_fsql_* references that only an import library
REM   (fractalsql-*-import.lib, the .dll's companion) would satisfy --
REM   the static .lib has plain fsql_* symbols, not __imp_ thunks
REM   (confirmed directly: LNK2001 on 33 __imp_fsql_* externals on the
REM   first real Windows run without it).
REM
REM The UDF entry points (fractal_search / fractal_edition /
REM fractal_version / ... plus their _init/_deinit) carry
REM __declspec(dllexport) via the FRACTAL_EXPORT macro in
REM src/fractalsql.c, so no .def file is needed and candle/light
REM downstream won't need to play with export tables.
REM /U_WINDLL: MSVC's /LD (building a DLL, this invocation) implicitly
REM predefines _WINDLL for the WHOLE compilation, not just when OpenSSL
REM itself is being built as one. openssl/e_os2.h keys its OPENSSL_EXPORT/
REM OPENSSL_EXTERN macros on exactly that macro: with it defined, every
REM EVP_* declaration in this file becomes __declspec(dllimport), the
REM wrong decoration against libcrypto.lib's real static archive rather
REM than a DLL's import stub (confirmed by reading e_os2.h directly:
REM "OPENSSL_OPT_WINDLL" is set iff _WINDLL is defined, which then picks
REM the dllimport branch). Same class of bug as libcurl's own
REM CURL_STATICLIB fix for its DLL-vs-static export macro -- /U removes a
REM predefined macro on the cl.exe command line, undoing what /LD set
REM before openssl/evp.h ever sees it.
REM
REM libcrypto's static build pulls in these system libs transitively
REM (ws2_32/crypt32/advapi32/user32/gdi32) -- the exact set can vary by
REM OpenSSL/vcpkg version; not independently verified against a real
REM Windows+vcpkg+MSVC build in this repo's own CI yet (see build-test.yml's
REM windows-gate-matrix, the actual verification gate). A missing one
REM surfaces as an "unresolved external symbol" link error, not a silent
REM miscompile, so it's safe to add more here if that happens.
