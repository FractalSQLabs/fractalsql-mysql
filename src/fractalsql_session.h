/* src/fractalsql_session.h
 * Connection-scoped fsql_ctx registry for fractalsql-mysql.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: mysqld is one shared multithreaded server process
 * serving every connection, so a plain file-static in fractalsql.so
 * would silently leak state (Diversify tuning, rolling D_q/overhead
 * stats, ...) across unrelated sessions, with one connection's
 * settings applying to another's query results. This registry gives
 * that kind of state a safe, connection-scoped home.
 *
 * KEYING: MySQL UDFs have no ambient access to a connection/THD
 * handle through the public UDF ABI (UDF_INIT/UDF_ARGS). There is no
 * portable way for a bare UDF to ask "what connection am I on" without
 * linking against server-internal headers, which this repo deliberately
 * does not do (see build.sh / Makefile, built purely against
 * libmysqlclient's public mysql.h). So callers pass their own session
 * key explicitly as a BIGINT UDF argument; the documented convention
 * (sql/install_udf.sql) is to pass CONNECTION_ID().
 *
 * LIFETIME / KNOWN LIMITATION: MySQL UDFs also have no on-disconnect
 * hook, so entries can't be reaped exactly when a session ends. This
 * registry bounds the damage with a hard capacity cap plus
 * least-recently-used eviction of unreferenced entries, and an
 * idle-TTL sweep (see fractalsql_session.c). Residual risk: mysqld can
 * reuse CONNECTION_ID() values over the server's lifetime under
 * sustained connection churn; a brand-new connection that happens to be
 * assigned a not-yet-evicted stale CONNECTION_ID() would inherit that
 * old session's Diversify state until it next calls
 * fractal_diversify_enable/set_params itself. The idle TTL bounds the
 * exposure window, but does not eliminate it. This is a documented
 * tradeoff, not an oversight.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY: every function here is safe to call concurrently from
 * different threads on different session_ids. A single session_id is
 * only ever touched by one thread at a time in practice (mysqld
 * serializes statement execution per connection), but the registry does
 * not assume that: entries are refcounted, so a concurrent eviction
 * sweep can never free a ctx a caller is actively holding, even under a
 * misused/shared session_id. For the search ctx specifically, where a
 * second thread would race the core itself rather than just the
 * registry's bookkeeping, both acquire paths refuse up front instead of
 * racing: the exclusive acquire variant fails against a second
 * concurrent exclusive acquire (see fractal_session_acquire_exclusive),
 * and the plain acquire fails with NULL if the entry is currently held
 * exclusively (an in-flight search), since a tuning/read call mutating
 * or reading the same ctx's Diversify state while a search is using it
 * would race the core just the same.
