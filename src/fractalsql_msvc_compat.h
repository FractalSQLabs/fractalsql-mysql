 * Minimal MSVC compatibility shims for the POSIX names this extension's
 * own translation units call directly. Included by every src\*.c TU that
 * uses the shimmed names (fractalsql_cognition.c, fractalsql_textsql.c,
 * fractalsql_session.c, fractalsql_enterprise.c) -- one definition here
 * instead of duplicated blocks per TU, following src\'s existing
 * shared-header pattern (fractalsql_session.h, fractalsql_parse.h).
 *
 * MSVC has no POSIX setenv()/unsetenv(), and neither the UCRT nor the
 * vendored community-sovereign-c.lib carries them (confirmed directly:
 * LNK2001 on both at link time on the first real Windows run). Wrap the
 * CRT's _putenv_s(), which updates BOTH the CRT environment and the Win32
 * process environment block -- exactly what the call sites need, since
 * the reasoning plugin (fractalsql-reasoning-http.dll, loaded into this
 * same process) reads every FSQL_REASONING_HTTP_* variable back with
 * getenv() at its own load time. _putenv_s(name, "") deletes the
 * variable, matching unsetenv()'s effect.
 *
 * THE DYNAMIC-CRT READER PROBLEM, confirmed in-process on the first real
 * Windows gate run (8.4): mysqld.exe is dynamically linked to the UCRT
 * (dumpbin /DEPENDENTS: VCRUNTIME140.dll + api-ms-win-crt-*), so
 * ucrtbase.dll initializes at PROCESS START and seeds its environment
 * block from the process env as of that instant. A plain _putenv_s() call
 * from THIS DLL's /MT-static CRT updates the static CRT's private environ
 * and (UCRT's one-way sync) the Win32 process block -- but ucrtbase's
 * ALREADY-INITIALIZED environ never re-reads the Win32 block, so
 * getenv() in any module linked against the DYNAMIC UCRT -- the vendored
 * fractalsql-reasoning-http.dll is exactly such a module (its import
 * table lists the ucrt api-sets) -- sees only the stale at-start values.
 * Net effect with _putenv_s alone: the bridge ran, the plugin loaded,
 * and fsql_reasoning_init() returned -2 ("FSQL_REASONING_HTTP_URL not
 * set", per the plugin's own stderr string) with no HTTP request ever
 * attempted -- the whole FRACTALSQL_HTTP_* -> FSQL_REASONING_HTTP_*
 * bridge was dead inside mysqld while every /MT fixture (cl.exe's
 * default /MT, whose private CRT environ is seeded at ITS DLL load time,
 * i.e. after the bridge) still saw the bridged values, which is why the
 * fixture-swap gates (29 think) kept passing while the real-plugin gates
 * (04/13/15/17/18/23/24 route/29c) returned NULL.
 *
 * Fix: after the static-CRT write, ALSO write the same variable through
 * ucrtbase.dll's OWN exported _putenv_s (resolved via GetProcAddress),
 * when ucrtbase is loaded into this process. That updates the shared
 * UCRT environ the dynamic-CRT plugin's getenv() reads -- and ucrtbase's
 * _putenv_s keeps its own Win32-sync behavior, so the two writes agree
 * on the process block too. GetModuleHandleW (not LoadLibrary) so a
 * fully-static process never pulls ucrtbase in merely by bridging; when
 * it returns NULL there is no dynamic-CRT reader to serve. Resolved per
 * call (no init-once caching): GetProcAddress is ~tens of ns and the
 * bridge runs under the load lock anyway (see the race note below), so
 * the extra indirection is not worth a static-state dance in a header.
 *
 * Guarded on _MSC_VER only, so a MinGW gcc build keeps the real POSIX
 * functions. Call sites already serialize the whole
 * setenv+fsql_load_reasoning step under the process-wide lock (see
 * fractalsql_cognition.c's "THE setenv() RACE" comment), so the shims
 * introduce no new race.
